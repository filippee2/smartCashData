An aggressive marketing campaign will precede this food distribution including local radio, local and international print media and social media.\n\nIn addition to the food distribution a weekly seminar will take place introducing the public to crypto assets in general and SmartCash in particular. During the weekly advertising, a local representative will make themselves available to radio stations for interviews. During these interviews, the spokesperson will invite the public to the seminars.\nDuring the promotional periods, food distribution and seminars all activity will be recorded for later use by the SmartCash community for promotion.\n\nIn addition, the public will be introduced to our partner MonkeyCoin, which at the current time is the only fully legal way to trade crypto assets in exchange for the local currency through bank account integration. SmartCash will take it’s place alongside Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum as the only sanctioned coins available on this exchange. It’s hard to overstate the importance of this first mover advantage.\n\nSafeguards\n\nProgress reports to the developers and community will be provided throughout the campaign, I understand that a yes vote places great faith in the project. An arrangement has been made that will safeguard the Smartcash coins from being dumped on the open market while at the same time providing the liquidity needed to pay the vendors that will be executing this very ambitious project.\n\nBudget and Schedule\nPlease see preproposal link\n\nPersonal Note\nI have been in close contact with the organizers on the ground in Venezuela and every single one of them are expressing their sincere gratitude for being given the opportunity to show what they can do. Venezuela has been hit hard by political forces but the people are incredibly resourceful as we are all about to see. On behalf of our new friends in Venezuela, I want to thank you very much for your generosity.\n\n** VEF to USD and SMART to USD are extremely volatile exchange rates, the numbers will not align with the budget but were accurate at submission. **",

            "description": "Objectives: Our minimum viable project (MVP) objectives are to create a peer to peer, fiat (USD and user’s local currencies) to SMART exchange allowing people in the same country to transfer funds from their local bank account into a SMART seller’s account and then receive SMART from the seller via SMARTdirect escrow.\n\nValue Drivers: SMARTdirect will enable people to more easily acquire SMART without having to first convert their fiat to BTC and then buy SMART on a centralized exchange. With only a 1% service charge it will also potentially save the users significant fees and currency risk from converting from fiat to BTC to SMART.\n\nMethodology:\n\nUser registers on the SMARTdirect website, enters SMART wallet address in profile and selects status (online and available or offline.) The user will also enter their country and whether they accept payments by Bank Transfer, Cash deposit, Paypal or Skrill. They will also state their trade conditions including time to complete trade etc. More payment options will be added later.\n\nStep 2 is optional where a user conducts KYC with IDnow Video Identification as an option to increase their “Trustworthiness Score”. This will also allow users to purchase with VISA/Mastercard, when this option is enabled. If the user prefers not to conduct KYC they will be entirely reliant on their track record on the site for their Trustworthiness Score.\n\nUser inputs a sale/purchase advertisement with either a static price or a price pegged to the SMART average floating rate plus or minus a specified %.\n\nA buyer will choose a sale advert based on user’s trust score and online availability requesting a trade.\n\nThe seller will confirm he wants to trade by sending the SMART for sale to the SMARTdirect escrow wallet, thus initiating the trade and opening an Instant Message conversation with the buyer.\n\nThe seller gives their bank account details to the buyer and waits for a confirmation that the deposit has been made. Depending upon the type of transfer to the account the trade will take differing time periods but as soon as payment has been confirmed as received, the seller can release the SMART to the buyer’s SMART wallet, minus the 1% transaction fee.\n\nUpon completion of the transaction the users will rate each other and leave comments on the transaction for other users.\n\nIn the event of a dispute, the transaction will be frozen for 7 days during which time the buyer and seller can follow up on the transfer with their respective banks, following which the trade goes into arbitration. If the transaction is satisfactorily resolved before 7 days the trade can be completed.\n\nIf the trade is escalated to arbitration status, SMARTdirect will evaluate all the evidence submitted, including chat history, sale conditions and documentary evidence, and then release the SMART back to the seller or to the buyer depending upon the evidence submitted.\n\nTeam: MyHotZone International Ltd, will be managing the development of this project, headed up by Niall Igoe, the Director of Operations. MyHotZone is a multi-service networking company that has been specializing in Hotspot services in the UK and Africa for the last 15 years. This includes the development of our proprietary Authentication Authorization and Accounting systems that have been integrated with Hotel Property Management Systems, payment gateways and other payment platforms.\n\nThe lead developer on this project will be Sri Rangan based out of the Netherlands, who has many years of experience developing blockchain based solutions, cryptocurrencies and decentralized apps running on Bitcoin and Ethereum platforms. He also has experience creating web and mobile apps, with Python, Node.js, React and React Native. Sri has over a decade of experience developing software for the aviation, oil and gas and banking industries. His experience in building an investments and securities trading app and platform for ING Bank Netherlands will bring a high level of competence to the execution of this project.\n\nOnce operational, SMARTdirect will be supported by MyHotZone’s 24/7/365 support team by IM and by telephone. At present this team supports guests and users of MyHotZone hotspots in UK and Zimbabwe around the clock.\n\nProgress tracking: The progress towards this project’s objectives will be tracked on Trello where each element of the development will be outlined and marked off as complete as they are dealt with. A progress report will also be generated for the SMART community following completion of each sprint as set out below.\n\nRoadmap:\nSprint 1 – The Basics: Repositories, Libraries, Frameworks, CI/CD \n\nDeliverables:\n- Web application with navigation hierarchy, basic theme\n- Build system for front-end, back-end and static assets\n- Continuous integration and deployment environment\n- URL for stakeholders to review the latest state of the web app anytime during the project\n\nSprint 2 – Designs & User Module\n\nDeliverables:\n- Detailed design for overall web app\n- Detailed mockups for all static pages\n- Early mockups for Markets (Buy & Sell)\n- User signup, signin, signout and account management\n\nSprint 3 – Markets Module\n\nDeliverables:\n- Detailed designs for Markets Sell\n- Seller flow\n\nSprint 4 – Markets Module\n\nDeliverables:\n- Detailed designs for Markets Sell\n- Buyer flow\n\nSprint 5 – Alpha Release, Security Audits, Testing\n\nDeliverables:\n- Bug fixes, missing features discovered along the way\n- Performance testing\n- Security audit and fixes\n- Alpha release for small group of early testers\n\nSprint 6 – Beta Release, Security Audits, Testing\n\nDeliverables:\n- Bug fixes, missing features discovered along the way\n- Performance testing\n- Security audit and fixes\n- Beta release for larger group of testers\n\n**Release**\n\nThis site will be translated into Spanish as a first step in internationalising it.",

            "description": "<p>Hi community, I am Mohammed Awal Sani from Ghana West Africa known as cryptowall on Smartcash slack forum. I am submitting my first proposal to embark on a Smartcash road show in my country Ghana. Ghana is a relatively large country in West Africa with 10 regions and each region to a capital city. I have since 2016 supported cryptotraveler in advocating crypto currency through meet ups and conferences under the umbrella of our free markets and liberty think tank: Centre for Liberty and Entrepreneurship - www.cleghana.org. We Have held several meet ups in Ghana including a three days liberty and entrepreneurship camp 2017 under the theme: Entrepreneurship, Growth and Competitiveness; the Block chain to The Rescue' which featured crypto currency throughout https://web.facebook.com/CentreforLiberty/. I am embarking on a road show in Ghana to propagate Smartcash to the entire nation. Young men and women will be recruited and trained on Smartcash to stand on roads for Smartcash evangelism in each region as part of the road show. The Smartcash road shows will see two meet ups, two radio discussions and one Television discussion in each of the 10 regions of Ghana. Each of these meet ups are expected to record not less than 40 participants each and Smartcash tokens will be given to newbie&rsquo;s and their addresses submitted to the community. The radio and TV discussions will feature call inn sessions for questions and answers and Smartcash tokens given to listeners who call to ask questions and or contribute. The radio discussions will be heard by about 20,000 people every week and about 50,000 viewers to the TV discussions. This road show when successfully carried out will make Smartcash one of the popular crypto currencies in Ghana and Africa and hence will increase the rate of adoption by a bigger margin. Each stage of the roadshow will be video recorded, pictures will be taken and article will be written and all submitted to the community for proof of work. Considering the price of smart cash today it will attract larger buyers to substitute smsrtcash for bank deposits and government treasury bills holding This project aims at covering the whole country starting from the three northern region and when the community is satisfied with the work the proposal will be rolled over for another three months. I am asking for 105350.379SMART every month with an average price of $0.0633612/SMART for the next three months to cover three regions then I will roll inn for another cycle in other to cover the entire country with SMARTCASH TALK within the next 12 months.

The main purpose of this proposal is to keep all our social networks up to date and thus continue to gain more followers by bombarding daily information and creating videos with different topics to deal with regarding Smartcash. We firmly believe that we must embrace the Hispanic community more aggressively because at the economic level Smartcash is one of the best alternatives that can be taken into account to save and invest due to the low economic income that many Latin American countries have. The current proposal will include the following: &bull; 1 weekly videos on the YouTube channel (Tutorial, Informative, Comparative, Educational, News, Interviews) &bull; 5 weekly posts on Instagram Facebook and Twitter (News, Surveys, Price, Information) plus repost &bull; Use of paid publishing and promotion tools for Facebook and Instagram &bull; Use of Radio Stations to offer information about the Smartcash cryptocurrency, as several radio stations have contacted us through the Smartcash Venezuela project to interview us. &bull; According to the situation we have with many people who attended the Smartcash Venezuela Project conferences, which still have problems opening their Wallets and obtaining Smartcash through the Exchanges, we will be holding a monthly meeting of up to 30 people to offer technical support in all the aspects that they need. The meetings will be held in a fairly large restaurant recognized in the city that currently accepts Smartcash as a form of payment whose owner is Mr. Nicol&aacute;s Guevara one of the people in charge of the Smartcash Venezuela Project. Personal Note I have been working in the networks of the project without stopping, providing support and assistance to those who need it but I need to activate the work team to develop everything that is specified in the proposal, I am sure that every day the demand for information of Smartcash in Venezuela will be greater and with the final implementation of Smartcash in Monkeycoin many people will need our help to clarify any doubt regarding the process of obtaining smartcash. We will establish Smartcash as the main cryptocurrency of Venezuelans.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Hello! I am Mark, the Founder of the Blockchain Library, https://blockchainlibrary.org/. I would like to create a Digital Blockchain Library Branch dedicated to the SmartCash community and platform to be located at https://smartcash.blockchainlibrary.org/. This would be useful as a way to grow, curate, and promote the SmartCash community globally. I first heard about SmartCash last week from Fordham University and believe there is a lot of potential with the community oriented focus. The Blockchain Library&rsquo;s goals are twofold: to provide easy access to resources on cryptocurrency research for scholars, academics, analysts, and anyone with an interest in cryptocurrency publications; the second is provide a historical timeline on the development of the blockchain field and to document the journey of its growth. The idea of having a community fund their own section really helps the Library scale and SmartCash would be the first to do so because of your innovative democratic voting proposal process! Deliverables/Job description of the proposal: Create Digital Library Branch for SmartCash on Web Server: Server costs for increased capacity, setup of Wordpress CMS and plugins, add topic voting plugin for SmartCash topics, create and configuration of RSS aggregator plugin and content sections dedicated to SmartCash. $2000 USD Branding the Library Branch: Hire a graphic designer to create original graphics for the SmartCash library branch, including branded items available to purchase online: $600 USD Write New Articles on SmartCash for the Library Branch: Write 4 unique articles per month of 1,000 to 1,500 words included citations of primary sources, for a total of 24 articles on SmartCash. One of these articles will be published as a Wikipedia page to provide an overview of Smartcash. Articles will include topics suggested by the community as well as on the fundamental principles and unique technology of SmartCash. I would like one or two to also be interviews with active community members / founders. Professional content writer at $12/hour and approximately 7.5hours per article (including original research, editing, formatting, unique image, publishing and comment moderation) $360 / month * 6 months = $2,160 USD Curate Other Articles on SmartCash for the Library Branch: Create citation lists and a link directory for important writing on SmartCash, books, articles, events (not created by the library branch itself). $600 / month for staff time dedicated to this, $3,600 USD RSS News Tracker + Daily Newsletter Digest: Create a feedly integration to combine RSS feeds, Google News Alerts, and Reddit discussions into one location at the SmartCash Library Branch website. Add automated tagging using important keywords in cryptocurrency. Curate, maintain, and promote the service. Premium API service fees and a WordPress plugin subscription are required. $500/month for six months, $3,000 USD Hire a Research Assistant and Social Media Manager to curate content focused on SmartCash on Twitter: Stipend for a Graduate Student at Georgetown University&rsquo;s Communication, Culture, and Technology Program. $500 per month for six months, $3,000 USD Endow a SmartCash cold wallet account to provide ongoing support for the SmartCash Branch of the Blockchain Library (server + maintenance costs past the project window, and to protect against price flucutations): 257,429 SmartCash. Total cost for 6 months of support of the SmartCash Branch of Blockchain Library: $14,360 USD, which is at the current rate is 242,571 SmartCash. My Current/Past SmartCash related experience: This is my first experience with SmartCash, but I have a strong background and drive to promote the community. I have a MA in Communication, Culture, and Technology from Georgetown University and seven years of experience in library science and information management. I will be pursuing the MSc in Digital Currencies from the University of Nicosia in 2018. My interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency stems from philosophy of technology and the change to communities brought about by innovative technologies at socially relevant times. SmartCash seems really promising and I would like to share it with the world more widely. The writer I am working (another librarian with a lot of experience) with has marketing other communities and written articles about their technologies, written interviews, etc. Possible FAQs: How will you decide what topics to write on? I think there could be a democratic aspect to this by having a voting system on the SmartCash Hub at Blockchain Library to identify possible topics. This would help to discover what topics are important, what technologies of SmartCash are unique to write about, and who would be interested in being interviewed. Why not create a completely new website domain? Having a connection to the blockchain library helps with the trusted branding and improved SEO so people will find materials on the SmartCash site. Who are you going to hire to help with this project? I can share my profile and the team&rsquo;s profiles. I am already in discussion with them. They are interested but funding can help us make time to work on this project apart from our regular jobs, studies, and family duties! What will you do if the price halves? If the price doubles? : If the price tanks we may need to reduce the support length to four months and then submit another proposal for funds (I can also find out if potential hires would accept SmartCash directly and not at a USD rate). If it doubles we would put it into a kind of &ldquo;SmartCash Branch&rdquo; endowment to support ongoing server costs in case a future renewal of support does not come from the SmartCash community. Conclusions: I hope the SmartCash community finds this useful to complement their existing website. Thank you for considering my proposal. Thank you for your time for reading my proposal! Sincerely, Mark Hakkarinen Founder, Blockchain Library</p>",

Alternatively, if the Hive would be particularly focused on 3-5 languages it would create extensive content in each of them. The priorities will be set in favor of SmartCash popularization according to ongoing working processes and team members engaged. But no matter how fast the Hive grow, funds be only spent as intended. Obviously the higher priority here is to allocate funds efficiently, rather than quick. If the new members join more rarely then expected, then it would just take more time.\n\nLanguage teams ready to start: French, Russian\nHigh priority languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Mandarin, German, Korean.\n\nFollow-up: the Hive will continue the work submitting detailed reports monthly and creating a proposal for the next time period based on expected job volume.\n\nHive structure: general translation coordinator, language ambassadors, and translators.\n\nHive members duties\n----------------------------------\n\nGeneral translation coordinator is responsible for:\n-enabling flawless funding for prioritized translation tasks \n-choosing topical content for multilanguage translation (with help of other members)\n-distributing the work among language ambassadors\n-overall quality of translations (especially in new language groups)\n-fast and efficient communication/funding of language ambassadors and translators\n-ensuring correct funds distribution\n-applying initial vesting process while organizing new language groups\n-mitigating possible issues and finding suitable solutions\n-submitting detailed financial reports on the Hive work\n-estimating new job volume and upcoming month expenses\n-submitting translation Hive proposal for funding\n\nDuring the Hive launch, the general coordinator should compile:\n-translation Hive funding proposal template\n-monthly financial report spreadsheets \n-working guidelines for global translation coordinator, language ambassadors, and translators\n-recommendations on vetting processes\n-spreadsheets for interaction between language ambassador and translators \n\nLanguage ambassador duties:\n-picking up skilled members of SmartCash to engage in the translation process\n-distributing jobs among them\n-assessing, validating and editing translations (proofreading)\n-ensuring high quality of translations\n-cooperating with general coordinator\n-submitting detailed reports with links to actual jobs done by his team\n-triggering translation of outstanding non-English material into English (in cooperation with other Hive members)\n-translating content himself (voluntary)\n\nTranslator duties:\n-to apply for the translation job (1 job at a time)\n-to submit a high-quality translation to language ambassador for approval and proofreading\n\nCosts structure\nPlease refer to the case scenario on the forum (the link on top) as here costs structure is described briefly. The starting point in costs is based on present market average translation pay which is currently estimated at $0.1 per word.\n\nThe quantity of language ambassador work directly corresponds to his group size and their job volume and is decided to be paid as 10% on top of their job volume. \n\nGeneral translation coordinator pay rate is based on the total job volume performed by translators and set as 7% on their total pay for the current proposal (the Hive launch will demand more involvement) and roughly estimated to be 5% on following\nproposals. Real life experience is needed in order to estimate working hours required for efficient function of general coordinator, and corresponding pay rate.\n\nProject implementation:\nThe translation Hive will reside on SmartCash subforum with categories respective to each language. The Hive will be deciding on high priority tasks with help of active SmartCash members. The whole working process together with funds distributions will be fully transparent and easy to monitor by any community member. The current plan is to utilize Excel spreadsheets for jobs distribution. Although it may be done more efficiently with relatively simple MySQL/PHP web-interface, at this stage spreadsheets would do the job. \n\nDedicated web-wallet for Multilingual Translation Hive is created where all the transactions will reflect actual ongoing processes within the Hive.\n\nCurrent positions allocated to:\n\nGeneral translation coordinator: @God\nRussian language ambassador: @God\nRussian translator: @Semptly\n\nFrench language ambassador: @Karl \nFrench translator: @Cknr7\n\nThe French team has prepared pre-proposal for French translation and decided, that in case the Multilingual Translation Hive proposal is approved, French team would join the Multilingual Translation Hive. If their proposal is submitted and approved, then French team will work according to their working plan, joining the Hive later on. In any scenario, the funds for the current proposal remain for the next period if not spent on time.\n\nIn order to learn more about Multilingual Translation Hive current members background and ask questions, please visit:\nhttps://forum.smartcash.cc/t/organising-multilingual-translation-process/1437",

            "description": "<p>With an estimated 274 million total speakers, French is one of the most spoken languages in the world. Translating the website in French would allow us to reach them more easily. We are both native French speakers. We believe that translating does not pursue practical goals only. It is also about branding. It expresses a little something about SmartCash&rsquo;s identity. Whereas a poor translation expresses neglect or even disregard, a good one is a sign of trustworthiness. It says: &ldquo;welcome, feel at home!&rdquo;. -Our first milestone is to translate the website and the 3 following guides: \"How to import privatekey from webwallet to windows wallet\", \"SmartRewards consolidation guide\", \"SmartCash Mining on Pool - A visual guide on how to set it up\". After finishing the translation, I will proofread it and harmonize it. The cost of our proposal is based on the following rates: $0,1 per word for translation, $1/100 words for proofreading. The small tip of $13.37 we will give to one of the authors of the guides is meant to incentivize the creation original content as well as motivate authors to allow translations (please refer to the pre-proposal discussion if you're interested in more details about how we calculate the tip and why only one author will get one). -Our second, third and fourth milestones consist of an ongoing maintenance during 6 months after finishing the aforementioned translations. During this time, we will translate all website modifications. Should there be only a few of them, we will translate interesting guides instead. Smarts will be distributed only after new translations and based on the same rate as the original translation, i.e. $0,1/word for translating and $1/100 words for proofreading. Every time a new translation is done, a detailed breakdown will be posted in the proposal thread. Finally we'd like to state that if Mastin's Multilingual Translation Hive proposal is approved, we will work within its framework. If you'd like to see a detailed breakdown of our proposal, please refer to the proposal thread: https://forum.smartcash.cc/t/website-french-translation-proposal/1524 If you're interested in more details, you can check the discussion in the pre-proposal thread: https://forum.smartcash.cc/t/french-website-translation-project/1440 Feel free to leave a comment in the proposal thread, we will answer!

This can be turned on and off via the plugin and the % can be adjusted by the merchant.\n\nTimeline: Early Jan 2018 *Dependant on new API\nTotal Hours expected for project to complete: 140 Hours+",

They will also be have the ability to enable SMARTCashBack, more on this below.\n\nGood UX for the End User\nWhen the customer submits an order, they are prompted to deposit the exact amount of SMART needed to cover their order (based on USD conversion). The plugin will work launch with EUR/USD/AUD with more support added with subsequent versions. Because of the technology behind SMART, confirmation time should be really, really fast.\n\nSMARTCashBack\nMany merchant websites using WooCommerce will use online payment gateways (such as Stripe or PayPal) that attract 1.5% - 3% + 30c fee on each transaction.\n\nTo encourage adoption, offering the end user a 1-3% discount (the Merchant can disable/change the %) will encourage adoption of using SMART. The customer get’s a discount simply by using Crypto and paying directly into a wallet.\n\nThis 1-3% fee would have been absorbed by the Merchant using conventional online payment methods - instead, using SMARTCashBack, it can be used to attract more customers and increase customer satisfaction.\n\nThis would tie in nicely with a Merchant directory too.\n\nWho Am I?\nMy name is Moe, I’ve been a full-stack developer for over 10 years and doing it as my full time job in Melbourne, Australia for over 7 years.\n\nI have extensive experience in GIT, Apache, NGINX, PHP, Wordpress, JS, CSS3, HTML5, iOS Dev, Swift, Obj-C\nI will be using my Personal time (outside of my full time job) to develop this plugin. It will be open source and available on Github.\n\nDeliverables/Job description of the proposal\n\n1. Backend Developer - PHP/API Developer: (40+ Hours) - Scope has changed as new API will allow for privacy and instant payment notification. **IMPORTANT: The project timeline is dependant on this API deployment**\n\n2. Design/Front End Developer - JS/CSS/Images: (20+ Hours):\nTesting : Setup of Test server, Test WooCommerce instance etc. (20+ Hours):\n\n3. Testing : Setup of Test server, Setup test WooCommerce instance, use many popular WooCommerce themes and plugins to ensure usable across the greater WooCom community. (40+ Hours) \n\n4. Deployment: Launching on Wordpress Repo/Bug Fix & Support (100+ hours - Mostly donated):\n\nMy Current/Past SmartCash related experience:\nI’m a new member but am committed to be active on Slack. I really believe in the SmartCASH concept, the incentive to Hold and the strategy to target merchants.\n\nPossible FAQs:\nWhy WooCommerce?\nWooCommerce is the largest known eCommerce platform with a huge 11% of the total internet running off it.\n\nAccording to BuiltWith Trends, there are an additional 160,000 WooCommerce sites per quarter! https://trends.builtwith.com/shop\n\nHow can I help?\nThe project will be open source on GitHub. Feel free to pull and contribute!\n\nWhat if I don’t want to use SmartCashBack?\nThat’s fine, the project will allow the merchant to turn on/off SmartCashBack.\nAs early adopters, we want to attract merchants with truely 0% fees, and also attract end-users by offering a cash back!\n\nConclusion:\nI believe this project is a critical first step to merchant adoption and true decentralised P2P online payments. The code will lead to a Magento adaptation.\n\nCoinPayment.net is nice, but ultimately, leads back to centralisation.",

We will not simply be tackling one small project but building a non profit entity aimed at maximizing the ecosystem of SmartCash and the visibility to outside parties.\n\nPartial Crowd-funding/non-profit model:\nI am hoping to create the first 3rd party DAO ‘HiveInfinity’ (hiveinfinity.com9) on the SmartCash blockchain that is not only crowd funded by the immediate community with a donation match by me for every coin donation to the general fund until further notice and jump start a small operation whose long term goal is widespread adoption of SmartCash and the growth of the overall ecosystem through the creation of new phone apps, websites, marketing campaigns & other means necessary to onboard 1 million new SmartCash users.\n\nSome of the deliverables of the DAO:\n\n1-3 mobile apps catered to ‘worldwide’ adoption within 6 months. Each concept will be disclosed in the future when things are more aligned for a pre-launch.\n3-5 high quality Smartcash focused web portals & platforms within first 1 yr.\nMany, many articles and write ups.

Over time we started to see a common need for something better, something smarter, and something more fair. And eventually that became the building blocks of SmartCash. I have been a Bitcoiner since April 2011 and instantly fell in love with the space and never looked back. I have been a full time crypto loser for about 3 years now and love everyone second of it. I no longer use the banking system of the past and hope to continue to help build the future with everyone here.\n\nI have a background in web design, marketing, all things technology and am quite surprised with my networking skills despite being sort of a dweeb, I have always loved to try new things, think up crazy ideas and push boundaries and this proposal is no different.\n\nPossible FAQs:\n\nHow will the money be managed?\nThe idea here is to utilize @slpin and the hive teams as an escrow service for the time being, which in turn creates a safe place for this money should anything go ‘wrong’ along the line. If the money is still being held by the hive teams after the goals have been accomplished, it will be donated into the smartrewards pool.\n\nWhat are the milestones for this project?\nEach Milestone would be on a project by project basis, money will not be debited unless required for funding of staff, integrations, advertising costs or other cost requires instances that I could no cover out of pocket.\n\nWhy so many deliverables?\nA successful marketing campaign takes a pronged approach, I have adapted this concept to focus on a more adoption level campaign but the concept remains the same. I believe the listed items are the main areas in which adoption can be pursued in a quick and effective manner.\n\nWhat is a DAO and why does SmartCash need one?\nA DAO is a fancy acronym for a group of people working together under the guise of a semi structured company like system with goals. The goal of this DAO is to pursue adoption and attempt to break through barriers in the space and in other verticals outside of it.\n\nHow will we maintain a non profit status and why?\nI personally do not need to be paid for any of this work as I have made enough money in crypto to be happy growing my current portfolio and the focus will be on creating value creating jobs, and most of all getting SmartCash into the hands of users. Not profit. There will be no company unless 100% required and if so it will be a non profit entity or something similar altogether.\n\nWhat is the donation matching program?\nI will be creating a website for this DAO and any donations to said Smartcash address will be matched at a 1:1 up until 500,000 SmartCash, this money will be used for things as we see fit and need without the need to dip into the grant.\n\nWill the team grow?\nYes, the plan is to start small, plan big, and hire as we need.\n\nWhat are the top priorities of this team?\nSmartCash Adoption Worldwide.\n\nWhy such a long timeline?\nThis was simply to make the point this is an open ended venture that I plan to pursue for a very long time. Rome wasn’t built overnight.\n\nWhat are ‘Major industry integration projects for specific industries.’?\nI have vast experience outside of SmartCash and have a few solid ideas for getting some headspace in these industries via the usage of custom applications and will create a side project/team to accomplish this.\n\nWhat is meant by ‘Constant unannounced ‘moonshot’ projects that will be funded behind the scenes and ninja launched as they are completed.’?\nThis is to stay competitive, we cannot promise EVERYthing we make will be successful or as ‘beneficial’ as others and thus would like a small bit of secrecy to create an ecosystem where failure will be tolerated in the name of learning.\n\nHow will extra funds be requested if needed beyond this initial grant?\nIf a project is deemed ‘expensive’ it will be made into its own proposal for the hive to fund or not to fund. We do not want to burn our grant quickly with marketing costs.\n\nConclusions:\n\nI hope to not only use this proposal to show everyone what it takes to do larger, more creative proposals and also get a head start on a great idea that, in my opinion, could be very huge for SmartCash over the next years and would love to dedicate my time to making this happen. Thank you all for taking your time to read this proposal, I hope to post it before the 10th of December.\n\nDonation Address for The ‘InfinityHive’ DAO\n\nSQJByezW9rwFd2H3gwXEcwn6is7LYpeVgJ",

            "description": "SMARTCASH\nREMITTANCE AND PAYMENT SOLUTIONS.\n\nSince we have fundings for previous proposal  for P2P smartcash to fiat exchange or  \"smart direct\" which will have direct exchange of smartcash to different fiats in your country. I would like to propose to further develop it as a Money Transfer tool that will exchange smartcash to fiats that can be encashed in remittance centers like western union or other remittance centers all over the world.\n\n*By this, we should have a mobile application (can be intergrated to present mobile wallet) that will make this smartcash to fiat, (and bitcoin) exchange.  Since smartcash transfer from one wallet to another costs mimimal transaction fee, it will be a much cheaper way of decentralized money transfer. And I know that remittance centers doesn't accept cryptocurrency coins yet to be encashed, so we need to have, smartcash to fiat exchange before sending fiat value to a remittance center or to a bank (this works like a paypal that can send money to remittance centers/ banks). This will be the \"cash out\".\n\n* Secondly, this smart mobile application should also have \"cash in\" options to deposit fiat money to smartcash mobile wallet, which can be done through online bank transactions, over the counter or through deposit from remittance centers. In this way fiat to smartcash exchange will be much accessible and more people can acquire the coin thus, providing mainstream use for the coin, and worldwide adoption.\n\n* lastly, for payment solutions. We can use this smart mobile \nApplication to make online transactions in a form of fiat stored in smart wallet app or with our own smartcash.\nAs we go mainstream, smartcash will be adopted as a currency. With this, we can use smartcash to buy or make payments/ transactions online, either to a friend, payment for monthly bill (electricity, phone bills, water etc). Can also be used to buy load, book flight or trip online and can work like a visa/mastercard for transactions using fiat/smartcash stored in smart app.\n\n*bonus:\nFor every transactions made in the smartcash, either through payment bills, buying load or online trasactions, a reward will be sent to the wallet in a form of smartcash. In this way, we did not only make transactions cheaper, we made it rewarding for the users of smartcash.\n\nThe aim of this is to have worldwide adoption and compete with the top coins in cryptoworld in terms of usage and adoption.\n",

            "description": "Puerto Ordaz and industrialized city in Venezuela, presents itself as one of the richest cities in our country and in the near future the epicenter of an economic revolution due to its enormous wealth in its subsoil. Puerto Ordaz, the city where the first 3 conferences of smartcash crypto were held, now people are showing their interest in cryptocurrency not just smartcash, and are looking for means to buy it. We want to fill the void of information left after the conferences and continue to create awareness by providing the tools necessary to gain the public’s trust and to help them get on the right path to start buying, saving and using the Smartcash Cryptocurrency.\n\nWe begin by the introduction of a Legal Framework provided by a local firm of Accountants, Lawyers and Business Administrators. This group of professionals will deliver the legal grounds according to Venezuelan Tax and Banking laws in order to adopt SMARTCASH CRYPTO as a sort of payment, or to store value.\n\nAlso with the help of the Chamber of Commerce Caroni we'll begin selecting and holding conferences with merchant enthusiasts about the implementation and adoption of SMARTCASH CRYPTO on each of their business. This also goes hand by hand with the common people, so that more and more people are integrated to the program. These conferences will address cryptocurrency basics, SMARTCASH benefits, legal framework and the use of the web exchanges and our own physical exchange!\n\nThe introduction of the first physical exchange for Smartcash crypto, begins as a simplification of the process of buying the cryptocurrency, people will trade FIAT for SMARTCASH and other cryptos for SMARTCASH ONLY. It will function as a facilitator of the conversion and also as an escrow service, in order to gain people's trust and therefore be the first exchange of their choosing when it comes to buying and trading! \n\nIn order to create awareness, we will also organize monthly charity events in low-income areas, hospitals and schools in the city of Puerto Ordaz that will provide food, clothing, medicines and healthcare with the collaboration of volunteers from the different colleges in the Puerto Ordaz area by financing community service projects proposals, also by including the people that will be part of this program thus projecting the smartcash community in puerto ordaz.\n\nGenerate databases of all the “users” in the smartcash community at puerto ordaz, alongside performing data analytics and metrics to create Monthly reports (number of wallets opened since the beginning of the project, volume of smarts being traded through the exchange, types of stores and the goods and services mostly bought with smarts, users profiles) This will provide valuable information to perform better marketing strategies.\n\nVenezuela is facing very difficult times, shortage of food, biggest inflation in the world, restricted access to other currencies, etc. This is why we see potential in cryptocurrency specially an emerging one like SMARTCASH, because with all of its benefits it provides us the tools to shield in some level the situation we are facing and if done correctly, and by combining all of our efforts, we think that mass adoption of Smartcash in our city will be a fact. The business model created can be then implemented in other cities for further expansion.\n",

Sea ice is retreating in the polar caps so the feeding grounds of the bears are getting harder and harder for them. They are literally starving. Here’s a video: https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/polar-bear-starving-arctic-sea-ice-melt-climate-change-spd/\n\nLet’s make this happen.

Every visitor will get a paper wallet with $ 10 in Smart, encouraging them to become part of the SmartCash community. The Lead organiser asked an entrance fee of $ 1.750, payable in Smart. Above that 300 times $10 in Smart will be distributed amongst the visitors by means of a paper wallet. My own work will be 15 hours of organizing and preparation $1.500,00. Above that I will have promotion material made, reusable for several occasions. At the moment I asked a company to make me an offer.</p>",

A majority of faucets provide information to new users as well as offering them some free coins so that they can ‘try before they buy’, experimenting with a test transaction or two before putting real money on the line. Since this whole experience is so new and a bit complicated to people, who perhaps don’t quite trust it with their hard money, this is a beneficial way to promote digital currency and bring in new users.",
            "description": "<p><strong>Amount:</strong>&nbsp;<br />&Sigma; 50 000.00 SMART per month</p>\n<p>I would like to offer users the opportunity to make use of the SmartCash faucet system that will pay into any SmartCash wallets. Since this project will be funded by the community hive budget, it will be without any outside corporate advertising but might include advertising that directly promotes SmartCash. This might include the latest news and development within SmartCash and updates from other DAO&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>Financials:<br />Monthly fee (ongoing): &Sigma; 50 000.00 SMART<br />This is to keep the faucet funded and to ensure that users can claim their free SmartCash. It will also cover a 10% monthly maintenance fee to cover hosting and monthly advertising cost to further promote the faucet.</p>\n<p>With regard to this monthly fee: (&Sigma; 50 000.00 SMART x *0.140123) about $7000 at this time.<br />(90% will go towards faucet payout ($6300) and 10% will go towards a maintenance account ($700)</p>\n<p>Faucet Payout ($6300)<br />Per claim payout will be calculated (weekly) with a formula to keep up with the coin growth but is currently set at a payout of 0.005 every 5 minutes. This will give a monthly average of about 9 000 000 claims.</p>\n<p>Maintenance fee will cover($700)<br />$13 for Website Hosting,<br />$250 for the services of a consultant to monitor the faucet website for any bot or suspicious activities, (All steps necessary will be taken to ensure each claim is claimed by a person and not a bot)<br />$300 for advertising of the faucet outside of the Smartcash system,<br />$137 for any unforeseen expenses (any leftover amount will be put towards the next months advertising budget).</p>\n<p>Unclaimed funds: <br />50% of unclaimed funds will be used to run various special promotions where users can claim a higher payout for a limited time duration. The other 50 % will be equally divided into the SmartRewards and SmartNodes (once available) program and any rewards out of these programs will be returned to the faucet for future growth.</p>\n<p>Transparency: <br />A monthly expenditure statement will be made available and uploaded to the faucet website.</p>\n<p>Timeframe: <br />Indefinite but will resubmit after the last milestone has been reached.</p>\n<p>About Me<br />Some of you might know me, if you don&rsquo;t, my name is Johan. I entered the online world in late 1997 as a user but in 2007 my life unexpectedly changed (You can read all about it on this website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.caringwheels.co.za/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.caringwheels.co.za</a>) and I had to turn to the internet to generate an income. In early 2008 I started an online import business that specializes in photographic equipment. I later sold this to a competitor in 2011 after I managed to build a small online store into a multi-million dollar business in less than 2 years. Since then I&rsquo;ve been involved in the crypto world and more specifically, I&rsquo;ve been involved in the faucet world form late 2013 when I crossed paths with a faucet developer.</p>\n<p>For the past 4 years, I&rsquo;ve been making a living (well tried to for the most part) from cryptocurrencies. It only started giving me a return on my investment this year with the enormous growth the crypto world has seen over the last 12 months.</p>\n<p>My biggest payoff (by more than 60%) in my personal portfolio comes from faucets. In my very first month of collecting from faucets, I managed to collect just under 0.5 bitcoin. This was when 1BTC was just under $90 compared to today&rsquo;s $19 000</p>\n<p>I for one is a HUGE supporter of faucets not only for the gains but also as a way to introduce new users to a currency.</p>",

It will be used only to show proof of payment to charities.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I have alot of experience in the medical field and a passion for helping those in need. I believe in philanthropy and charitable works. I don&rsquo;t believe in needing a reason to help someone. These donations will be made in the name of the SmartCash Community and I believe it is a noble cause.</p>\n<p>Any questions or comments are appreciated, I can be reached in the SmartCash discord @Shiradi</p>\n<p><strong>Thank You</strong></p>",

            "description": "<p>Kenyan Women for SmartCash</p>\n<p>Half of Kenya&rsquo;s estimated 45 million population are women. Moreso, this country also is known as Silicon Savannah, as a term that is used to refer to the technology ecosystem it has developed. It is one of the foremost leaders in Cryptocurrency alongside, African countries like South Africa, Nigeria, and Ghana.</p>\n<p>Weekly Bitcoin meetups are normal in the tech-savvy environment, and because Bitcoin price has skyrocketed at an alarming rate, attendance for these meetups have doubled, if not quadrupled, as a result.The overwhelming majority of the meetups are normally filled with smart, conscientious women who want to know more and ready to invest.</p>\n<p>However, with over 1300 plus altcoins in the crypto ecosystem, the majority of the meetups only focus on Bitcoin. Trading Bitcoin in the Kenyan Crypto ecosystem can be confusing, expensive and time-consuming. Women are alert to the Cryptocurrency space, as such, they are anxious to learn more. Which is why this space of awareness would be the opportune environment to discuss the benefits of altcoins by promoting a solid Coin like SmartCash.</p>\n<p>I am a crisis communication and women&rsquo;s leadership professional who often make TV appearances and is asked to speak and write about issues concerning political strategy, crisis communication and, close to my heart, women empowerment. A novice to the crypto world, I was initially introduced to Smart Cash by Frisco d&rsquo;Anconia aka Cryptotraveler, a team member of SmartCash. Since then I&rsquo;ve sung SmartCash praises to the extent, several colleagues have purchased SmartCash.</p>\n<p>My plan is to organize SmartCash Sessions with women leadership, women business groups, and social groups throughout the 15 Counties in Nairobi and Mombasa.<br />Short-Term focus:<br />&bull; Getting started with altcoin<br />&bull; What is Smart Cash<br />&bull; Setting up and maintaining a wallet<br />&bull; Understanding exchanges and how to trade<br />&bull; Obtaining and accumulating SmartRewards<br />&bull; The state of cryptocurrency legislation and regulation in Kenya<br />&bull; How to grow SmartCash business - Merchant Acceptance</p>\n<p>Long-Term focus:<br />&bull; Establishing a community of SmartCash Ambassadors<br />&bull; Developing Women SmartCash investment hive</p>\n<p>Target Audience:<br />&bull; Women ages 25-45<br />&bull; Employed and entrepreneurs<br />&bull; Low, Middle and High-income levels</p>\n<p>Sessions:<br />&bull; 15-20 women per session<br />&bull; 25&nbsp;sessions</p>\n<p>Cost Considerations:<br />Cost Considerations:<br />$2,000 per county (5 counties) (Space Rental, transport and lunch/dinner) which totals $10,000.00</p>\n<p>$400 per county for branded marketing materials-i.e. t-shirts, mugs, pens, notepads, memory sticks which totals $4,000</p>\n<p>Fixed cost to account my time, arranging logistics and which will also include stipends for volunteers total estimated time per county 10 hours per 5 counties totals $ 2,500.00</p>\n<p>200 Smart Cash rewards, 20pax and 15 counties totals 60,000 Smart Cash rewards.</p>\n<p>Total Cost:&nbsp;$16,500<br />Smart Rewards: 500</p>\n<p>Women in Kenya are smart, dynamic and looking for opportunities in the cryptocurrency space.

It is crucial to have a internationally protected brand in order to be successful on the next level of business development. Unfortunatly the <strong>trademark is already taken</strong>. (see here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4803:18zilv.3.3\">http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4803:18zilv.3.3</a>&nbsp;)</p>\n<p>This necessity to rebrand smartcash into a community trademark arises out of the need beeing perceived as&nbsp;<strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>fast</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>confident</strong>.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #339966;\">The solution:</span><br />Therefore we will create the first European Hub Office, where we will steadily&nbsp;work on implementing the product on the everyday money usage in Europe.

In fact the Hive Structuring Team will have to accept the vote of the community and rebrand all wallets and websites. But we will support this process with the rebrand bounty for all contributers, who may apply to us.</p>\n<p>LET's ILLUSTRATE THE WORLD THE POTENTIAL OF SMARTCASH!</p>",

The comprehensive marketing and public relations initiative presented in this proposal primarily uses news networks in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia and Latin America to educate the general public of the advantages SmartCash offers the worldwide community. It also includes reaching out to journalists that have covered digital currencies in the past, retargeting the individuals who discover SmartCash through our efforts, and boosting third-party coverage through social media channels to those who have expressed interest in the space. Please note that because our focus is on news channels and promoting editorial-style content, this proposal is not meant to replace traditional marketing initiatives suggested by others and in fact harmonizes with other forms of marketing very well.

            "description": "<p>As all professionals in IR, PR and marketing know, the best campaigns involve creating a plan that uses the right blend of complementary solutions together for a synergistic approach. We&rsquo;ve found the most effective strategies involve laying a strong foundation, proper delivery of news, guaranteed follow-up editorials with mass distribution, third-party voices via social media network and a prominently displayed profile, reaching out to writers/journalists as buzz grows, ongoing engagement with retargeting and multiple methods of communication, and steady promotion to new audiences with shared interests.</p>\n<p><strong>Interactive presentation of our detailed plan (<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">IMPORTANT TO VIEW</span>):</strong> <a href=\"http://www.blockchainrelations.io/presentations/smartcash\">http://www.blockchainrelations.io/presentations/smartcash</a></p>\n<p><strong>Pre-Release of our SmartCash profile featured on &ldquo;Crypto Spotlight&rdquo;:<br /> </strong><a href=\"http://www.blockchainrelations.io/crypto-spotlight/smartcash-smart/\">http://www.blockchainrelations.io/crypto-spotlight/smartcash-smart/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Goals of this project:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dramatically increase the number of people familiar with SmartCash</li>\n<li>Generate excitement for SmartCash innovations among writers/journalists</li>\n<li>Increase the size of the global SmartCash community</li>\n<li>Stay in front of business leaders who are candidates for accepting cryptocurrencies</li>\n<li>Continually brand individuals introduced to SmartCash with retargeting service and ongoing updates</li>\n<li>Start bridging the enormous gap between mainstream audiences and the cryptocurrency market</li>\n<li>Broadcast new developments and philanthropic initiatives to the masses</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why start now:</strong></p>\n<p>The most successful public relations campaigns are started before major news is announced. In addition to getting &ldquo;more eyeballs&rdquo; on the project, you also create history and familiarity with target markets which make them far more open to engage when news arrives later. Also, keep in mind we do not intend for this engagement to only last 90 days. The only reason a 3-month term was set was to ensure community members would feel comfortable moving forward since there is only a short commitment. We will be eager to cover all the big announcements made throughout 2018 and beyond as well.</p>\n<p><strong>What we bring to the table:</strong></p>\n<p>This comprehensive plan was put together utilizing the specialized knowledge gained through assisting more than 200 small, publicly traded companies over the past 12 years. Blockchain Relations, a registered tradename of The Global Precision Group (est. March 2010), was specifically formed to leverage the first-hand cryptocurrency knowledge and mass news distribution experience of Jonathan Keim (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathankeim/) and his team to bring mainstream media and the cryptocurrency markets together. The infrastructure and relationships we already have in place to serve publicly traded companies touches hundreds of millions of people around the globe; a sizable percentage of which now hold bitcoin and are eager to be further involved in next-generation blockchain technology. To date, we have worked with Neblio with measurable success and are actively looking to help more projects benefit from larger audiences and better visibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Why we love SmartCash and already &ldquo;hodl&rdquo; it:</strong></p>\n<p>SmartCash has been on our radar since around $0.15. Our favorite features are self-governance and self-funding, which of course ensures long-term stability and growth. Steady price appreciation, SmartRewards, multiple languages, a community fund with considerable resources, and a friendly community with great support are other qualities that make this a top cryptocurrency. We believe regularly broadcasting these features to those who may only know of Bitcoin and Ethereum will significantly grow SmartCash&rsquo;s number of fans and users.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the linked flipbook-style proposal, partners involved in this proposal will hold 55% of the funds received for a minimum of six months and will continue to hold the majority of this percentage for as long as we service the community through 90-day renewals.</p>\n<p><strong>A notable change made since &ldquo;pre-proposal discussion&rdquo; on forum and Discord:</strong></p>\n<p>We are adding $1,005 for each of the global press releases so an extra 100 words can be added. Added costs are split equally between the three milestone payments. The additional flexibility will allow for us to explain how to acquire SMART on exchanges since many of those who hold Bitcoin need help understanding how to access the alt coin exchange market. The 400 words included at base price wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to do this as well as make a proper announcement. In fact, to give an example of what 100 words amounts to, this paragraph totals exactly 100 words.</p>\n<p>We also expanded our focus to assist SmartCash with all of its social media accounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential concerns:</strong></p>\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t been given concrete confirmation a &ldquo;News Section&rdquo; will be added to the SmartCash website, although we&rsquo;ve attempted to secure this ahead of time. If this section isn&rsquo;t added for us, we will provide a different service of equivalent value instead of providing the content for this new section. Also, if retargeting code isn&rsquo;t added to the SmartCash website as requested, we will use our own website pages about SmartCash to collect the targeted audience in order to fulfill our obligations in this proposal. If anyone has direct communication with the SmartCash web development team, please help connect us with them (or vice versa). Additionally, we need contact with the social media manager(s) to assist with official SmartCash accounts or will instead make equivalent efforts with our own channels as a substitute. We&rsquo;re moving forward with the belief that the right people will present themselves as part of serving the community desires.</p>\n<p><strong>The three phases and future renewals:</strong></p>\n<p>This 90-day proposal is split in three 30-day periods. The impact of our efforts will be felt towards the end of this term; not the beginning. Fifteen days before the end of this 90-day proposal, we plan to submit a new proposal to carry on and make enhancements to the initiatives presented in this proposal. Please note that as with all forms of branding and marketing, consistency is key. Our approach has always been to steadily build audiences and increase engagement methodically over time through continual branding. We view this 90-day proposal as only the first step in a long-term journey to build momentum by maintaining top visibility.</p>\n<p>First phase: Lay groundwork and make initial introduction to mainstream audiences<br /> Second phase: Keep new audiences engaged and build momentum by expanding outreach<br /> Third phase: Analyze data accumulated, refine communication strategies and continue engagement</p>\n<p><strong>Project needs:</strong></p>\n<p>Total for all three phases: US$ 73,015.00 in SmartCash equivalent</p>\n<p>Itemized by cost, this budget covers three press releases with global distribution via GlobeNewsWire ($12,060), additional 100 words for each press release ($3,015), annual subscription to our preferred text alert service ($179.40), editorial syndication to NetworkNewsWire&rsquo;s 5,000 news outlets 7 times ($3,500 estimated), PRWeb distribution of third-party announcing editorial coverage of SmartCash 7 times ($1,743), retargeting budget ($2,500), social media advertising boosting third-party content ($15,000), and two ticker-tagged, multi-day release campaigns to tier-one financial websites and blogs ($19,995). The remainder covers (a) writing the introductory profile, 3 press releases, SmartCash.cc news section content, assistance with SmartCash social media, ad content, 7 editorials, 7 editorial announcements, creative texts for alert service, communication on Discord and the forums, and content for major ticker-tagged PR campaign; (b) ongoing research; (c) setting up text alert service, news alerts and social media strategy; (c) administrating the submission of press releases, editorial syndication, retargeting campaign, social media advertising and management, text alerts, interview, ticker-tagged PR campaign coordination, gathering of community feedback and overall strategy; (d) reaching out to a minimum of 100 journalists; (e) detailed analysis of the data collected to increase the effectiveness of this campaign and better design future ones; (f) and, of course, covering operational costs of our business. On this first-time engagement, we will be providing coverage of SmartCash progress and link to editorials via all 7 brands of the Brand Relations Brand Network (<a href=\"http://www.brbn.io\">http://www.brbn.io</a>) at no additional cost as well as placing SmartCash in the Crypto Spotlight section of the Blockchain Relations website.</p>",

Many dedicated community members donate their time to help others by fielding&nbsp;questions and concerns.

You must periodically clear the files contents. You can do that by restarting smartcashd or with the following linux command: echo '' &gt; ~/.smartcash/debug.log (if you are not currently logged in as the user running smartcashd, you will need to switch to them first). You can also follow the procedure below: etc, etc</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Each of these meet ups are expected to record at least 50 participants whereas the radio discussions will be heard by about 40,000 people with phone in sessions for questions and answers. SmartCash tokens will be given to participants at each campus and listeners who phone in and answer questions during the radio programs.\nThe motivation behind this project is to promote SmartCash through education and marketing for massive adoption and usage in Ghana and Africa at large.\n",

More than 50 participants are expected to attend the workshop at each selected campus (University of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), University for Development Studies (Tamale), University of Cape Coast and the University of Education (Winneba).</p>\n<p><strong>Action Plans:</strong>&nbsp;All participants would be trained on how to set up SmartCash wallets and how they can also promote it through their social media accounts and also bring more ideas in promoting SmartCash. In addition, Ten (10) Participants from each university who seems active and demonstrate excellent understanding of the blockchain technology and SmartCash technology would be selected to serve as campus Ambassadors for SmartCash. Below is the planned activity for them:-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All participants will be trained on the blockchain technology, Cryptocurrencies with emphasis on SmartCash, how to download and setup SmartCash wallets, key features of SmartCash, how to purchase SmartCash from local and international exchanges, and the advantages of using SmartCash for their daily transactions like payments of goods and services, payment of fees/bills, receiving remittances and many more. $5 worth of SMART will be given to the first 20 participants at each university and have them send some of it to other participants. This will make them feel the speed and convenience with SmartCash and also give them experience in using SmartCash immediately. Students will therefore be encouraged to use their savings to purchase SmartCash to accumulate capital and wealth using SmartCash and SmartRewards as store of value in the long term to realize their entrepreneurial goals, further education, etc.</li>\n<li>Participants will also be trained on Digital marketing, Business Planning &amp; Execution, proposal writing, and how they can achieve their entrepreneurial goals through wealth creation by accumulating capital through SmartCash and SmartRewards in the long term.

We will also establish campus clubs in their respective university campuses. These groups will be trained to teach students on how to make use of SmartCash and SmartRewards as store of value to realize their entrepreneurial ideas after successful graduation. They will be provided $500 worth of SmartCash as support to organize school-based and cluster-based workshops in their respective campuses. The clubs will also be supported to educate management, the Student Representative Council (SRC) and other campus based groups and associations to start accepting SmartCash for payment of fees and/or other association dues. SmartCash may have to sponsor some of their activities to gain more popularity on each university campus.</li>\n<li>Finally, Ambassadors of SmartCash will be trained to be merchants that trade in SmartCash in Ghana for extra income. Their extra duties are to convince households, business associations and professional groups such as teachers, nurses, accountants, lawyers in Ghana to buy and hold SmartCash for the long term.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Timeline:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>University for Development Studies (Tamale) 2days workshop (1st week)</li>\n<li>University of Ghana 2days workshop (2nd week)</li>\n<li>Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology(KNUST) 2days workshop (3rd week)</li>\n<li>University of Cape Coast 2days workshop (4th week)</li>\n<li>University of Education (Winneba) 2days workshop (5th week)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>BUDGET</strong><br /> Transportation to Each University Campus - $1100<br /> Hotel accommodation &amp; feeding - $2400<br /> Hiring of Venue for workshops - $1500<br /> Feeding Cost of Participants - $400<br /> Tokens for participants - $600<br /> Printing of SmartCash shirts - $1400<br /> SmartCash Clubs Fund - $2500<br /> Media Engagement - $1000<br /> Banners for workshops - $250<br /> Communication and data calls - $100<br /> Cameraman for videos of workshops - $500<br /> Contingency - $250<br /> <strong>Total</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>$12,000</strong><br /> we are therefore asking for&nbsp;<strong>$12,000/equivalent amount of SMART</strong>&nbsp;to be able to carry out this project.</p>\n<p><strong>JUSTIFICATION:</strong>&nbsp;<br /> a.

As an adoptee, she endured bullying growing up and has made it her mission to &ldquo;take the sting out of bullying&rdquo; by doing what she does best: singing.</p>\n<p>She earned her BFA from Montclair State University and made her off-Broadway debut in Freckleface The Musical, based on the New York Times bestselling book by Julianne Moore. She toured internationally in the cast of Green Day&rsquo;s American Idiot, and has shared the stage with Green Day, The Hives, Danzig, Die Antwoord, Flogging Molly, and Linkin Park. She has provided live backup vocals for Rachel Platten, Andy Grammer, Gogol Bordello, and Kelly Rowland. Her vocals can also be heard on the soundtrack to Patti Cake$, which premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival.</p>\n<p>Tobi currently tours with Gogol Bordello as a singer, dancer, and percussionist. She appears as a guest vocalist on &ldquo;Did It All&rdquo;, the first track off Gogol&rsquo;s 2017 album Seekers and Finders. When she isn&rsquo;t traveling the world, she enjoys partnering with Concerts in Motion to bring music to nursing homes, soup kitchens, and hospitals.<br />Tobi eagerly anticipates the upcoming release of her debut EP Puzzle Piece, through which she shares her inspiring story of self-discovery: becoming her most authentic self, and developing her personal motto - &ldquo;Be true to you&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>In 2015 Tobi took her motto a step further and founded Be True to You: a musical, interactive anti-bullying program that empowers kids and teens to &ldquo;Take the Sting - Out of Bullying&rdquo; through education and original pop/rock songs. Be True to You has received accolades from parents and teachers alike. For her advocacy work, Tobi was the honored recipient of Meaningful World&rsquo;s International Youth Peace Award at the United Nations in 2016.</p>\n<p>Here is a short video of Tobi discussing BTTY:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RScnXr98Go\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RScnXr98Go</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good for Smartcash</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased brand awareness: Tobi has agreed to include a &ldquo;Sponsored by smartcash&rdquo; sticker along with our logo on her banner for the next 9 months</li>\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffff99;\">SmartCash will receive special mention on the art of an upcoming music album</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffff99;\">SmartCash will receive special mention inside an upcoming children's book</span></li>\n<li>Better our public image: Supporting an anti-bullying program will increase our public persona by showing everyone we are a community that cares</li>\n<li>Less bullies mean a better world for us to live in</li>\n<li>We'll be supporting a cause that has a bee theme!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What I am asking for</strong><br />I am asking for funds to help Tobi expand her program and allow her to continue showcasing BTTY to get it into more schools.

I am a chef with over 12 years of experience, an Asian food trader.<br />With my ability and experience, along with your trust.

Then, they will calculate the profit for you.</p>\n<p>* Important: I will accept payment with SmartCash. There will be a 5-10% Cashback promotion</p>\n<p>* I can tell you that the profitability of investing in supermarket food is huge. With my hiring time, I have assisted my boss ... he has about 20 supermarkets in Germany.</p>\n<p>* Dear SmartCash community! At present, the value of altcoin depends largely on the value of bitcoin. Imagine, SmartCash as a parent, company or stores we invest ... bring value, great income to the owner of SmartCash. This is a solid foundation that helps keep SmartCash values ??from being affected by the crypto market.</p>\n<p>* Money is divided into 3 phases:</p>\n<p>Stage 1: $ 600,000 Once the proposal is accepted</p>\n<p>Stage 2: $ 400,000 After signing the contract with the supermarket. Have a business license</p>\n<p>Stage 3: $ 200,000 Opening day (start of business).</p>\n<p>* Contract period in Supermarket, as well as opening hours may not be accurate for Milestone. It depends on many issues. I will do my best to respond to the community's trust!</p>\n<p>I want to disclose personal information:<br />- Tweet: lovestern83<br />- fb Email: lsb108@gmail.com (Name: Kevin Nguyen)<br />* My English may not be accurate ... look forward to your understanding!</p>",

We support individuals, companies, and governments in line with providing people the means to live a good life.</p>\n<h1>Mission</h1>\n<p>To create global communal health, linking startups and existing organizations with SmartCash and the New Vision Network model for business to business service networks, utilizing subscription donations to fund the services and process.</p>\n<h1>Philosophy</h1>\n<p>To unite is to progress. Division and competition have only proven to bubble and burst. NVN and SmartCash aim to generate a healthy community of business interaction based on unity that welcomes new startups to our network family while empowering the strength of our global business family.</p>\n<h1>Partners - Regions (Network Channels)</h1>\n<p>SCJG Creative Consultant - International (low to high-level network)<br />Colin Howard - National (low to high-level network)<br />Christian Simms Communications - International (mid to high-level network)<br />Happiness For All - International (all network levels)<br />Estival - Midwest Region (low to mid-level independent producer network)<br />Jeff Storey - International (entrepreneur, high-level network)<br />Guerrilla Signs - National going International (inventive signs, ultimately a tool for networking into leading minds)<br />Brenda King - Midwest/International (Holdings Company successes, currently starting a new HC, high-level network)<br />JB Consulting - Midwest/Northeast/International (high to mid-level network, serving mid to high-level startups)<br />Daniel Brummel - National (music educator, entertainer, entrepreneur, mid to high-level music network)<br />Bodlar - National (artist, entrepreneur, mid to high-level artist and business network)<br />Michael Knight - International (mid to high-level investor network)<br />Ross Silva - National (mid-level business consultant/network)<br />Johnny Colbert - National (mid-level business consultant/network)<br />Jay Skinner - National (entrepreneur, mid-level business consultant)</p>\n<p><strong>SmartCash will be claimed as a founding partner if interested in utilizing the NVN model.</strong></p>\n<h1>Current and Actively Networking Channels</h1>\n<p>SCJG - Exponentially gaining network<br />CH - Actively cultivating network in Colorado<br />CSC - Reputation combined with existing strong network<br />Estival - Great way to find upcoming artists and fresh producer talent<br />Guerrilla Signs - Constantly using their inventive signage tool to get the attention of leading minds<br />JB Consulting - Constantly adding value to new potential network nodes, expanding rapidly<br />Michael Knight - Constantly adding investors to his network</p>\n<h1>Value</h1>\n<p>The value is in the New Vision concept, existing network, &amp; heart-based philosophy that SmartCash supports. An evolving synergy of businesses, artists, and entrepreneurs with a similar desire for the wellbeing of mankind will lend to an attitude of service &amp; collaboration within the network. This culture of serving and helping others will integrate into onboarding partners while they utilize our services to empower their company&rsquo;s Mission on Earth. This rapid expansion of the potential services available creates exponential value in the New Vision Network.</p>\n<p>Culture Values: Why shouldn&rsquo;t our companies also behave as Loving as we do with our friends and family? Our network will be an example of how business can follow this same degree of principle-centeredness and do so for the benefit of all those involved. A business entity should have an obligation to follow similar values and spread the same Truth. SmartCash already is based upon this virtue and will be an integral part of helping other businesses and organizations do the same.</p>\n<h1>Concept</h1>\n<p>H4A.ORG (501c3) will be the umbrella and face of the NVN model, funded by donated subscriptions through SmartCash, around 3 core foundations, and the businesses within the network. This will expand the network and will amplify the value of b2b network building. Core Funders donate a larger subscription fee, which is utilized to pay professionals or businesses for their services accessible now for free to all subscribed to the NVN network. This also helps in bringing new companies into the network fold while also funding H4A and SmartCash&rsquo;s real-world endeavors. Core Funders have the perk of advising the network growth, securing strategic business partners through the NVN model directed by SCJG.</p>\n<h1>Example</h1>\n<p>See Google Slide next to \"Description\" above for Visual</p>\n<p>Startup &ldquo;A&rdquo; requests services from H4A. Through the already established network of SCJG &amp; JB Consulting, H4A connects the proper company, or professional to the task(s). The company or professional is paid from the pool of funding provided by the donated subscription fees. Startup &ldquo;A&rdquo; signs the agreement accepting free services from H4A and allowing their professional service/trade to join the larger service network while activating their own SmartCash donation to subscribe to NVN.</p>\n<h1>Deliverables</h1>\n<p>$3k - 3 Months initial SmartCash Network Subscription (all services of NVN available to SmartCash)<br />$5k - Initial Network Service Fund<br />$6k - 3 Months Pay to SCJG for activating NVN and pitching to major Foundations<br />$2k - Funds for developing and supporting pitches to be most impactful.<br />$3k - Travel funds for 3 people including SCJG to pitch to national Foundations<br />$1k - Web Development &amp; Misc Backup - Any funds not used will go into Network Service Fund</p>\n<h1>SmartCash Involvement</h1>\n<p>Silas is a new SmartCash activist slowly integrating the currency into his network and business dealings. Silas believes SmartCash aligns with the New Vision Network model, and his mission to unite business relations in a new, extremely valuable and impactful way. This will be a powerful vein for SmartCash to stretch through, be actively used, and influence real-world companies and startups.</p>\n<h1>FAQs:</h1>\n<p>Q: I don&rsquo;t understand&hellip; can you explain this all simply?<br />A: I am offering a national network that will provide professional services to SmartCash, startups, Foundations, and individuals, all the while empowering the use of SmartCash for the services and securing a financial future for the family of companies. The subscription fees pay for all service requests within reason and are in line with SmartCash endeavors and the New Vision Network Mission.</p>\n<p>Q: How much are you asking for a subscription to the network?<br />A: In order to cover the range of costs that may be necessary for higher-end services, $1k/USD (in the form of SmartCash) per month will be the subscription fee for SmartCash and 3 core/major foundations. If individuals or smaller companies wish to subscribe to the network services, the fee will be $50/per month with a max of 4 service requests per month.</p>\n<p>Q: What exactly will the initially requested funds be used for?<br />A: The initial funds will be utilized to create powerful presentations for pitching to major foundations about SmartCash and the New Vision Network model, such as the Hershey&rsquo;s and Ford Foundation which SCJG can easily get a meeting with. SCJG will lead these presentations and will execute them within the 3 month period proposed. Documentation of activity will be shared throughout the process! Funds will pay for time, resources, travel, and general accommodations to focus on establishing a SmartCash subscription with core Foundations and companies.</p>\n<p>Q: What if there&rsquo;s a lull in service requests? Where will the money go that&rsquo;s not utilized?<br />A: A pool of service funds will always keep growing so that we can onboard higher and higher end services without needing to raise subscription fees to the network. Once the service fund reaches $5k, 15% of anything pooled over this amount will start to be set aside to re-invest into SmartCash, and for real-world endeavors requested by the core funders/foundations.</p>\n<p>Q: Why is H4A the central hub everything&rsquo;s filtered through?<br />A: Happiness For All is a non-profit that SCJG is working closely with. Using H4A as a face and entity to channel the subscription donations through will allow proper and trackable tax activity for SmartCash, and anyone subscribing to the network, reducing the risk of federal legalities.</p>\n<p>Q: What makes your network so valuable?<br />A: My network can facilitate almost any need you can imagine for a professional service. Instead of paying thousands for a one-time specialized service, I am offering a subscription to a full-service network of high-level companies to utilize.</p>\n<p>Q: What types of services are we talking here?<br />A: Multimedia services of all types including websites, graphic design, video, photo, and audio. 3d Printing. Business Consulting. Ad Placement. Signs, banners, and unique physical marketing. Investment. Event Production. Welding. Construction Services&hellip; As more companies are brought into the fold, the service list will keep expanding!</p>\n<h1>Milestones</h1>\n<p>Initial Funding (relieving other obligations during 3 month implementation period) for SCJG to focus on NVN | $6k-usd<br />Establish Advisors, Establish Pitch Team, Set up meetings with foundations | Within 1 Month | $3k-usd<br />Create Pitch Presentation For Foundations | Within 2 months | $5k-usd<br />Develop Website w/ Subscription Payment Service w/ SmartCash &amp; USD | Within 3 months | $2k-usd<br />Execute Pitches | Within 3 months | $2k-usd<br />Obtain subscription donations from current network | Within 3 months | $2k-usd</p>\n<h1>Conclusions</h1>\n<p>New Vision Network is a subscription model that enables real-world companies to implement SmartCash and promote it for use while activating a healthy new business to business model.</p>\n<p>SmartCash will be offered and encouraged to be used as a payment method for all services within the NVN. Utilizing SmartCash will provide stability for all businesses against the failing fiat dollar, offering long-term business security. Subscription fees can be only accepted in SmartCash and reduced once a critical mass of subscribers is reached.</p>\n<p>Once all major industrial services are offered through NVN, the value of the network will rise exponentially. SmartCash founders will be encouraged to advise the network model and help the currency become a staple in the world economy through real-world services.

Making SmartCash available to the masses would be very beneficial to the community, early SmartCash adopters, and of course the exchange. Furthermore, Binance has the most professional team when it comes to exchanges, which in the past has been an issue after the exploit that locked many exchanges for weeks and artifically increased the price of smart, which is not good. When the amount is raised, I will start discussing with the Devs to submit to Binance, as it's better to have founders or devs apply than just part of the community.</p>",

This is a good opportunity to SmartCash gain massive exposure to a crypto-friendly target demographic, during the championship fights and all media that revolves around the event (magazines, sports blogs, social media and etc...)<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Exposure to SmartCash:</strong></span><br /><br />The athlete undertakes to use the sponsoring brand as an official brand, using his t-shirts, kimonos, patches, rashguards and other products in championships, photographic productions, social networks and other media channels. The athlete will be tweeting about SmartCash and possibly mentioning it during interviews.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The audience:</strong></span><br /><br />The demographic target of this type of event is ideal for SmartCash and is consistent with our user base. The championships attract a male demographic group from 18 to 49 years, which is the same demographic as the typical cryptographic enthusiast and initial adopter. Usually, the audience for the days of competition is about 5K, however, this year there will be several international championships in Brazil and, as a result, more than 20K spectators are expected for these larger events and if we take into account other media such as Streaming on Social media and Television, sports blogs among others, the exposure easily reaches 500K. With this sponsorship, SmartCash could be the first alternative cryptography that many of these viewers are aware of.<br /><br />Some of the great events that will happen this year:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://ibjjf.com/championship/floripa-fall-international-open-jiu-jitsu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://ibjjf.com/championship/floripa-fall-international-open-jiu-jitsu/</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://ibjjf.com/championship/brazilian-national-ages-18-and-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://ibjjf.com/championship/brazilian-national-ages-18-and-up/</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://ibjjf.com/championship/floripa-fall-international-open-jiu-jitsu-no-gi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://ibjjf.com/championship/floripa-fall-international-open-jiu-jitsu-no-gi/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>About me:</strong></span><br /><br />It is 7 years of training so far, in 2017 I participated in some important competitions and in all I had satisfactory results.

The workshops/conferences shall be open to all interested persons including CEOs of businesses, investors, the media (TV, Radio, online & print) and the general public at large. \n\nThe project will see two meet ups/training, a 30 minute radio discussion program, a meeting with the Student Representative Council (SRC), establishment of merchant centers, and creating online platforms in all the 5 selected Universities. Each of these meet ups are expected to record at least 100 participants whereas the radio discussions will be heard by about 40,000 people with phone in sessions for questions and answers. SmartCash tokens will be given to participants at each campus and listeners who phone in and answer questions during the radio programs.\n\nThe motivation behind this project is to promote SmartCash through education and marketing for massive adoption and usage in Ghana and Africa at large.\n",
            "description": "<p>Ghana is a relatively large country with an estimated population of over 27 million people. The youth plays a major role in the development of any country. Unfortunately, there is a continues increase in graduate unemployment in the country giving students the need to leverage available opportunities against the web of unemployment hence students take keen interest in speculative returns in SmartCash towards accumulating capital to start businesses after school. &nbsp;The good news is that, most students in Ghana are involved in mini-importation such as smart phones, laptops and accessories. Most of these students have over the years resorted to Bitcoin for online shopping. However, Bitcoin transaction fee and confirmation time have most of them seeking better alternatives as bank payments is also very expensive process. This thus, provides an appropriate platform to actually promote SmartCash through the youth who are mostly in the Universities.</p>\n<p>The training will be held in five (5) different university campuses across the country. More than 100 participants are expected to attend the workshops/conferences at each selected campus (&nbsp;University of Ghana&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ug.edu.gh/\">https://www.ug.edu.gh/</a> , Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)<a href=\"https://www.knust.edu.gh/\">https://www.knust.edu.gh/</a>, University for Development Studies (Tamale)<a href=\"https://www.uds.edu.gh/\">https://www.uds.edu.gh/</a> , University of Cape Coast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ucc.edu.gh/\">https://www.ucc.edu.gh/</a> and the University of Education (Winneba)&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uew.edu.gh/\">http://www.uew.edu.gh/</a></p>\n<p>We have successfully organized meetups on Smartcash in Ghana. Check it out here&nbsp;<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/p9ofP\">https://imgur.com/a/p9ofP</a>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/JB0DA\">https://imgur.com/a/JB0DA</a></p>\n<p><strong>Action Plans:</strong>&nbsp;All participants would be trained on how to set up SmartCash wallets and how they can also promote it through their social media accounts and also bringing more ideas to promoting SmartCash. In addition, Ten (10) Participants from each university who seems active and demonstrate excellent understanding of the blockchain technology and SmartCash technology would be selected to serve as campus Ambassadors for SmartCash. Below is the planned activity for them:-</p>\n<p><strong>Event Plan</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>30 minutes radio presentation on SmartCash in all 5 university campuses.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li>All participants will receive;</li>\n</ol>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li>5 minutes training on the blockchain technology. Presentation by (Speaker 1)</li>\n<li>10 minutes training on Cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, ethereum, etc. Presentation by (Speaker 2)</li>\n<li>30 minutes training on SmartCash. Presentation by (Speaker 3)\n<ul>\n<li>how to download and setup SmartCash wallets</li>\n<li>key features of SmartCash ie Smart forums, SmartRewards,SmartVoting, Smartnodes etc</li>\n<li>how to purchase/buy SmartCash from local and international exchanges via CoinExchange,Cryptobridge,HitBTC etc and</li>\n<li>Advantages of using SmartCash for their daily transactions like payments of goods and services, payment of fees/bills, receiving remittances and many more.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>$5 worth of SMART will be given to the first 50 participants at each university and have them send some of it to other participants. This will make them feel the speed and convenience with SmartCash and also give them experience in using SmartCash immediately. Students will therefore be encouraged to use their savings to purchase SmartCash to accumulate capital and wealth using SmartCash and SmartRewards as store of value in the long term to realize their entrepreneurial goals, further education, etc.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Participants will also be trained on Digital marketing, Business Planning &amp; Execution, proposal writing, and how they can achieve their entrepreneurial goals through wealth creation by accumulating capital through SmartCash and SmartRewards in the long term. Finally, Students will be allowed to submit business ideas for mentorship and execution.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. Ten (10) students from each university who attained outstanding skills in the workshop will be trained to promote SmartCash among colleague students and lecturers as campus Ambassadors for SmartCash. We will also establish campus clubs in their respective university campuses. These groups will be trained to teach students on how to make use of SmartCash and SmartRewards as store of value to realize their entrepreneurial ideas after successful graduation.They will be provided $500 worth of SmartCash as support to organize school-based and cluster-based workshops in their respective campuses. The clubs will also be supported to educate management, the Student Representative Council (SRC) and other campus based groups and associations to start accepting SmartCash for payment of fees and/or other association dues. SmartCash may have to sponsor some of their activities to gain more popularity on each university campus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. Finally, Ambassadors of SmartCash will be trained to be merchants that trade in SmartCash in Ghana for extra income. Their extra duties are to convince households, business associations and professional groups such as teachers, nurses, accountants, lawyers in Ghana to buy and hold SmartCash for the long term.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>University for Development Studies (Tamale)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2days workshop (1st week)</li>\n<li>University of Ghana&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2days workshop (2nd week)</li>\n<li>Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology(KNUST)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2days workshop (3rd week)</li>\n<li>University of Cape Coast&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2days workshop (4th week)</li>\n<li>University of Education (Winneba)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2days workshop (5th week)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BUDGET </strong><br /> Transportation cost to and within all 5 universities for 5 weeks &nbsp;- $1100<br /> Hotel accommodation &amp; feeding for 5 weeks - $2400<br /> Hiring of Venue for workshops for all 5 universities - $1500<br /> Feeding Cost of Participants for all 10 workshops/conferences - $400<br /> Tokens for participants for all 10 workshops/conferences - $600<br /> Printing of SmartCash shirts, stikers, fliers etc for participants across all 5 universities- $1400<br /> SmartCash Club Fund &nbsp;for all 5 university clubs - $2500<br /> Media Engagement with 5 radio stations across all 5 universities &nbsp;- $1000<br /> Banners, website publications for all 5 universities - $250<br /> Communication and data calls &nbsp;for organizing all 10 workshops/conferences - $100<br /> Cameraman for videos of workshops for all 10 workshops/conferences - $500<br /> Contingency - $250<br /> <strong>Total</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>$12,000</strong><br /> We(SmartCash TeamGh) are therefore asking for&nbsp;<strong>$12,000/equivalent amount of SMART</strong>&nbsp;to be able to carry out this project.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JUSTIFICATIONS:</strong>&nbsp;<br /> a.

The roadshow has been successful in the two regions with participants mainly worried about how to get smartcash and where to spend it and this has necessitated incorporating businesses and merchant adoption into the roadshow activities. The roadshow will continue from the southern part of Ghana which is also the business hub starting from Accra in the coming months. Each region will still see two meet ups/conferences, two radio discussion and a TV discussion with a minimum of 40 participants per meet up and business presentations to bring businesses and merchants on board and to equip participants with the knowledge of what smartcash is, how to get started, how to trade in smartcash using exchanges and other online portal and the benefits of holding smartcash for longer period.",
            "description": "<p>Hello smartcash family! My name Mohammed Awal Sani known as Cryptowall on the smartcash discord page, from Ghana West Africa. I am submitting this proposal as my smartcash roadshow extension and to embark on extra activities on businesses and merchant adoption. The first phase of the smartcash roadshow in Ghana has been successfully done covering upper east, northern region and upper west region which constitute the northern part of Ghana. Videos and pictures of the first phase can be found here on my YouTube channel <span class=\"mention\">@cryptowall55</span>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/smartcashgh/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/smartcashgh/</a> and <span class=\"mention\">@cryptowall55</span> on twitter.<br /> I have since 2016 supported cryptotraveler in advocating cryptocurrency through meet ups and conferences under the umbrella of our free markets and liberty think tank: Center for Liberty and Entrepreneurship - <a href=\"http://www.cleghana.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.cleghana.org</a>. This project will be one of the best project for smartcash in Ghana and Africa.<br /> The second phase of Smartcash will be geared towards the southern part of Ghana. The roadshow will go beyond meet ups, radio discussions and Television discussion. This will see business and merchants approach to get merchants and businesses to accept smartcash and make it an alternative medium of exchange to the Ghanaian cedis. Each of these meet ups are expected to record not less than 40 participants each and Smartcash tokens will be given to newbie&rsquo;s and their addresses submitted to the community. The radio and TV discussions will feature call inn sessions for questions and answers and Smartcash tokens given to listeners who call to ask questions and or contribute. The radio discussions will be heard by over 20,000 people every week and over 1000,000 viewers to the TV discussions. At least 10 businesses and merchants will accept smartcash in the shot to medium term. The success of the roadshow in the northern part of Ghana so far has made smartcash one of the popular digital currencies in Ghana and the current extension aims at making smartcash the first cryptocurrency to have physical store front and kiosks and businesses where smartcash holders can exchange and/or use their fiat for smart and smart for fiat and for purchase of goods and services in Africa.</p>\n<p>The aim of this proposal is to extend the current smartcash roadshow and to also introduce merchants and business integration to smartcash in another three regions of Ghana in the next three months with the aim of using existing MOBILE MONEY/MPESA agents to incoporate smartcash into their operations.</p>\n<p>This cycle of the project will start from march and end in May. This will start in the national capital (Greater Accra region) to the Ashanti region and end in the Brong Ahafo region with each region getting at least five mobile money agents recruited and trained to exchange smartcash for fiat and fiat for smartcash.Meetings will be held with at least two business to push the agenda to get some businesses start accepting smartcash as a medium of payment for goods and services in Ghana.</p>\n<p>This project will contribute significantly in pushing smartcash to be the best digital currency interms of addoption and usage and a perfect alternative to the fiat currency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I am asking for US$19866 every month for the next three months to cover three region, Greater Accra, Ashanti and Brong Ahafo region then I will roll inn for another cycle in other to cover the entire country with the smartcash roadshow and business adoption campaign.</p>\n<p>BUDGET</p>\n<p>Transportation to and within each region for one month&nbsp;

We will publish it on the forum and pinn a message it the already existing Telegram group.</p>\n<p>If the admins allow it we would also like and article on the official SmartCash Steemit to promote the refferal program to our communtiy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How will the refferal program work?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Register with the SmartCash refferal bot on Telegram @smartcashrefferal_bot</li>\n<li>Submit your SmartCash address with the bot to receive your refferal bonuses</li>\n<li>Start adding users to the SmartCash Telegram group by clicking on \"Add member\"</li>\n<li>Get paid for your refferals to the SmartCash Telegram group</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Refferal program rules en conditions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You earn 2 SmartCash for every refferal</li>\n<li>Minimum of 3 refferal to be eligible for a payout</li>\n<li>After 20.000 SmartCash is paid in refferal bonuses the program will stop</li>\n<li>Every refferal needs to be added one by one otherwise the bot will not count them as a refferal</li>\n<li>All refferals will be checked after 7 days, if the refferal left the Telegram group within that time it will not count as a refferal</li>\n<li>Payouts will be done once a week by Vlad and myself (with a limit of 750 induvidual payments a week, if there are more payments to be done, they will be moved to the next week because of the time it will take processing them)</li>\n<li>Once a week Vlad an I will publish all results + payments of that week on Telegram and on the SmartCash forum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Total costs for SmartCash refferal program:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>20.000 SMART in refferal bonuses</li>\n<li>1.000 SMART for the creation of the Smartcash refferal bot (Made by Vlad already completed)</li>\n<li>5.000 SMART for processing the payments</li>\n<li>500 SMART for the proposal paymemt and preparations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Total: 26.500 SMART</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

            "description": "<p>As many of us know, Social Media is a great way to get the word out about great currencies like Smart Cash.</p>\n<p>Twitter has been an incredible source of information for me personally when it comes to Smart Cash and other Cryptocurrencies. Although Twitter is great, I spend more of my time on Instagram.</p>\n<p>I would love to see Smart Cash grow a large following on Instagram. Instagram has over 800 million monthly active users and is still growing rapidly. There is a great opportunity for Smart Cash to reach thousands or even tens of thousands via Instagram.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal/Who I am</strong>: My name is Andy Dew. I currently manage over 30 Instagram accounts and grow targeted followings on each account. I would love to do this for Smart Cash at a fraction of the cost it would be to outsource to someone who isn&rsquo;t invested and a part of the Smart Cash community. I own a Smart Node and I&rsquo;m active in the Smart Cash discord (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.smartcash.cc/u/cryptodino\">@CryptoDino</a>) and really believe in this project.</p>\n<p>I log into these Instagram accounts and follow, occasionally like, and unfollow based off things like followings of similar/competitor accounts, hashtags, and locations. This eventually generates around 800-1,500+ new followers per month (the number varies quite a bit based off things like quality of content posted on the account). Engagment also increases on the acount (higher number of likes and comments per post). I&rsquo;ve grown my personal account (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/andydew/\">@AndyDew</a>) to over 49k followers. Feel free to look at my content and check out my interaction and engagement levels.</p>\n<p>Other Instagram accounts I currently manage:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/johnmho/\">@JohnmHo</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/justinbrownfit\">@justinbrownfit</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/marektarkowski555\">@marektarkowski555</a></p>\n<p>Feel free to ask me on Discord or DM me on Instagram if you'd like to see examples of other accounts I manage.</p>\n<p>There is no reason Smart Cash shouldn't have one of the largest and most active followings on Instagram, for a community focused Cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>Here is the timeline and milestones I am proposing:</p>\n<p><strong>Initial TimeLine: 3 Months</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Amount to be paid in Smart Cash dollar equivalent: $450 ($150/month).</strong></p>\n<p>The cost goes toward:</p>\n<p>software costs ($40/Month), daily time spent monitoring account and generating monthly reports ($10/hr).&nbsp;<br />This service is soley for growing the Instagram account. The current person managing the Smart Cash Instagram will continue to post content as usual.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline: 3 months</strong>: I will produce a progress report each month, showing the growth/progress of the account.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As of March 2nd 2018, Smart Cash has 799 followers. The last 5 posts have an average of 76 likes per post.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone number 1 (Arpil 18):</strong> Average growth of 400+ new followers per month and over 100 likes on every post.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone number 2 (May 18):&nbsp;</strong>Average growth of 600+ new followers per month and over 150 likes on every post.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone number 3 (June 18):&nbsp;</strong>Average growth of 900+ new followers per month and over 200 likes on every post.</p>\n<p>After three months a new proposal will be generated for something more long-term (6-12 months) and the community can decide if the Smart Cash spent is worth the following that is generated from this service.</p>\n<p><strong>Total hours expected for project completion:</strong>&nbsp;25-40 hours.</p>\n<p>I look forward to seeing Smart Cash generate a larger, more establsihed Instagram presence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Andy</p>",

Smartmerchants get listed on Smartport.cc, get support on organising the payments in Smart and will be invited to the ambassador community. The individual ambassador has to be rewarded for his or her efforts. The needed budget depends on the size of the merchant. The size of the merchant is measured on the number of cashdecks.

First it will be a portal where the merchants get listed and where SmartCash can be bought. Through the year and the years to follow, the site will get more and more sophisticated. Merchants can build a webshop on the site, SmartCash can be bought and sold, maybe we can even list other currencies on the site.<br />The development of the site should be an ongoing process. Stage 1 will be used to design the site, get it working for buying Smart, so the Public can download a wallet and buy Smart directly, without first buying BTC. In this stage the first merchants who accept SmartCash will be listed. If the budget is sufficient, there will be built in a peer to peer selling facility as well. For this stage a budget is needed of $ 20,000.</p>\n<p>Together with that comes the promotion of Smart on social media. A serious campagn costs around $ 300,000 a Year. We will keep it simple, but we need one person who will dedicate at least 20 hrs a week for the campagn.

We will list the merchants on Smartport.cc. We will support the merchants in programming their website in order to be able to accept SmartCash and we will support other merchants to facilitate payments in SmartCash in their shop or restaurant.</p>\n<p>Smartport needs a budget per merchant. Smartmerchants get listed on Smartport.cc, get support on organising the payments in Smart and will be invited to the ambassador community. The needed budget depends on the size of the merchant. The size of the merchant is measured on the number of cashdecks. Webshops are rated by the number of yearly visitors.<br />Needed budget: $ 2.000,00 per Cashdeck. Webshop, $ 1,00 per yearly visitor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Perform as a speaker on several events (goal 5 in stage 1)</strong></p>\n<p>Needed Budget: $ 2.000,00 per occasion. This is the fixed fee, and will be used to cover travel expensel/ hotel costs, promotion material, booking costs etcetera. The events will be used to promote SmartCash, to build the community of ambassadors and merchants.

Fifteen days before the end of this 90-day proposal, we plan to submit a new proposal to carry on and make enhancements to the initiatives presented in this proposal. As with all forms of branding and engagement initiatives, consistency is key. Our approach has always been to steadily build audiences and increase engagement methodically over time through continual branding. We view this 90-day proposal as only the first step in a long-term journey to build momentum by maintaining top visibility.</p>\n<p>The first half of our proposal lays a solid foundation via content creation, adding impact to grass roots efforts, building awareness and establishing credibility. The second half of our proposal continues these efforts while starting journalist outreach and reaching many more people by placing SmartCash in heavily trafficked news sections of large-cap companies via NetworkNewsWire&rsquo;s Brand Awareness Distribution program (see details: <a href=\"http://brbn.io/K4IUo\">http://brbn.io/K4IUo</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Interactive flipbook showing overview of each phase:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.blockchainrelations.io/presentations/smartcash/strategy-overview\">http://www.blockchainrelations.io/presentations/smartcash/strategy-overview</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ccffcc;\">Full details are available upon request.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10815\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.choiceroofcontractors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/strategy-overview.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px\" srcset=\"//i0.wp.com/www.choiceroofcontractors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/strategy-overview.jpg 756w, //i0.wp.com/www.choiceroofcontractors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/strategy-overview-300x122.jpg 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"756\" height=\"307\" data-id=\"10815\" /></p>\n<p><strong><u><br />What We Bring to the Table</u></strong></p>\n<p>This comprehensive plan was put together utilizing the specialized knowledge gained through assisting more than 200 small, publicly traded companies via our parent company The Global Precision Group (established 8 years ago). Blockchain Relations, a registered tradename, was formed as a special division to leverage the first-hand cryptocurrency knowledge and mass news distribution experience of Jonathan Keim (<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathankeim/\">http://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathankeim/</a>) and his team to bring mainstream media and the cryptocurrency markets together.</p>\n<p>The infrastructure and relationships outlined above are already in place and capable of touching millions of people around the globe; a sizable percentage of which now hold bitcoin and are eager to be further involved in next-generation blockchain technology. We are also leveraging 8 different in-house brands to provide ongoing third-party coverage of every news event to reach more individuals, eliminate the stigma of self-promotion, attract further interest and provide new perspective. Our long-term plan calls for further expansion and SmartCash will gain the increasing benefit of this growth throughout the next 12+ weeks.</p>\n<p><strong><u><br />Goals of this Proposal</u></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continually place SmartCash in front of millions of people visiting news sites every day</li>\n<li>Encourage more grass roots efforts through increased recognition and added impact via news dissemination</li>\n<li>Build up credible content for people to discover while campaign is underway</li>\n<li>Grow the SmartCash community by bridging the gap between mainstream audiences and the cryptocurrency market</li>\n<li>Position SmartCash as a next-generation cryptocurrency that solves real-world problems in a practical way</li>\n<li>Educate the market of how easy it is to accept cryptocurrency via SmartCard and highlight its many benefits that are unrivaled by other payment technologies</li>\n<li>Increase the prominence of the SmartCash website through valuable backlinks and increased traffic</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><u><br />How Others can be Involved</u></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit content on the new SmartCash News Media Tracker website</li>\n<li>Join the Communication Task Force to discuss outreach strategy on weekly basis</li>\n<li>Become part of core team (requires 6+ months of engagement, deep knowledge of SmartCash and commitment to long-term success)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: Founders will be a key part of this campaign as well and we&rsquo;ve been in regular communication with Decentralizd. Approvals will be gained before official press releases are disseminated.</p>\n<p><strong><u><br />How Payments are to be Made</u></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Milestone payments must be paid in the order specified for the community&rsquo;s peace of mind (i.e. a new phase can&rsquo;t be paid for until the prior one is finished).</li>\n<li>Each global press release will be paid upfront due to high expense, but will be fully written prior to disbursements of funds. </li>\n<li>Management/administration, articles and their distribution costs, journalist outreach and all other costs are paid at the end of each month once completed.</li>\n<li>The brand awareness distribution campaigns are paid upfront individually, but we will pay the full amount for both campaigns ourselves after receiving payment from accountant of the first half for the first campaign. This is to reduce community risk while still securing the large discount for committing to do two campaigns instead of one.</li>\n<li>All other items are paid once deployed/completed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><u><br />Breakdown of Costs in Pie-Chart Format<br /></u></strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10817\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.choiceroofcontractors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/budget.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px\" srcset=\"//i0.wp.com/www.choiceroofcontractors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/budget.jpg 756w, //i0.wp.com/www.choiceroofcontractors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/budget-300x272.jpg 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"756\" height=\"686\" data-id=\"10817\" /></p>",

It was never easier to create great videos with animated puppets before.</p>\n<p>This technology is just one year old and very few people are able to use it yet. using a quality puppet for that creates stunning effect and will stand out of the masses very easily.</p>\n<p>Example puppet from me (made by @kayrex):<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ucCq0gKXks</p>\n<p>**Proposal Goals**<br />_The proposal includes the following goals:_</p>\n<p>**Smartcash Mascot**</p>\n<p>The mascot and un-rigged puppet will be created by the illustrator Joseph Sanchez aka [@kayrex](https://steemit.com/@kayrex) from Steemit who has created several puppets for me. He is very skilled and creates amazing cartoon designs as you can see on his Steemit profile. The character will be devloped in a scalable vector format.</p>\n<p>Here is another example design @kayrex has created for me recently which I made into a puppet:<br />![Asset%202|484x500](upload://faJAPHr5LhADfW5cjCgGdNsFzeh.png)</p>\n<p><br />I will ask for five sketches which will be shared on the Smartforum for discussion and to pick our favorite for further development. The final mascot design will be publicly available as soon as it is done.</p>\n<p>For the mascot I propose **a cool bee** as that works well with the hive identity of SmartCash and we already have a design with a bee circling on Steemit. I am open to alternatives before bringing this to the official proposal.</p>\n<p>**Animated Puppet**<br />After receiving the vector file with all relavant layers for different mouth and eye shapes, as well as different expressions and various animations like buzzing wings for example I will begin the rigging process and create a working puppet file within Adobe Character Animator (ACA).</p>\n<p>As soon as this puppet is done it can be loaded by anybody into ACA and used immediately for video recordings and even life-streams without any further setup. The puppet will be available to all Hive members for quick import.</p>\n<p>**Promotion Videos**<br />The five videos will be each about two minutes long. Each videos will be semi-animated with the puppet as narrator and photos/screenshots/screencasts in the background. The videos content of the videos will be:</p>\n<p>1. SmartCash - General video about Smartcash<br />2. SmartHive - Introduction to the SmartHive<br />3. SmartRewards - Introduction to SmartRewards<br />4. SmartNodes - Introduction to SmartNodes<br />5. SmartVoting - Introduction to Smartcash proposals and SmartVoting</p>\n<p>The videos will be made available to download for all SmartHive members to use, reupload and share. All Hive members can and should share the final videos on their channels.</p>\n<p>**Steemit Promotion**<br />All videos will be uploaded to DTube, the Steem-based video platform, and with upvote-bots catapulted to the trending page. Unlike on other social media websites it is easy to make the entire network see our posts by boosting it enough. They will remain on the top of the trending page for about 2-3 days - visible to the ENTIRE NETWORK - before they are replaced by other posts. As Steemit is a very crypto-based community we will easily find many new Smartcash users as my previous Smartcash posts have already proven when looked at the comment section.</p>\n<p>**Amount**</p>\n<p>Breakdown</p>\n<p>* $750 for the design of the mascot with ten different expressions and layers for five extra animations in vectorized .AI format. This is a very complex and time intensive task.<br />* $250 for the rigging process of the puppet.<br />* $500 for each video production ($2,500 for all five)<br />* $400 per video promotion on Steemit/DTube ($2000)</p>\n<p>Total: $5,500</p>\n<p>_After completion of this task I would like to continue working with the puppet and create more content and maybe even life-streams but that is for a future proposal._</p>\n<p>Lots of love from Costa Rica,<br />**Florian Dell&eacute;**<br />_Steemit Smartcash MVP_</p>",

            "summary": "\nHello community, my name is Mohammed Mashud Kofi, known in the Smartcash community as Momako. Women and ladies are an integral component of our communities. They are indispensable in nation building and economic growth. No nation can thrive devoid of women. Women have a lot of influence and as such I am proposing SMART CASH FOR LADIES. This project focuses on unearthing innovative and doable ideas from female Ghanaians in our contemporary society.\nThe aim is to organize conferences in three (3) prime regions of Ghana. That is the Greater Accra Region, the Western Region and the Central Region. These training programs is solely for ladies and it’s anticipated at training 200 ladies and young women in each of the three (3) regions. The conference and training programs shall be opened to all Ladies from various facets of the Ghanaian economy; Female Directors, Female Politicians, Female CEO’s, Female Bankers, Female Teachers, and Female Tertiary Students. Etc.\nThe project will see one meetup and a booth camp, a 15 minutes TV discussion and a 20 minutes radio discussion. The media discussions will be heard by not less than 50,000 people. This is because the selected media houses in each region are the most prime, popular and most listened to media houses in the various regions.  These media houses have also been ranked best on several platforms. The media houses are; TV 3’s (New Day Show) (www.tv3network.com), Joy FM (www.myjoyonline.com) in the Greater Accra Region, Eastern FM (www.easternfm.com) in the Eastern Region of Ghana and Twin City Radio(https://twincityradio.com) in the Western Region of Ghana. Even though the target group of the training programs is ladies, the media discussions will be heard by both males and females. Listeners would be allowed to ask questions through phone in after presentations, Smartcash tokens will be given to listeners who phone in to answer questions during the radio and TV discussions. The reason behind this project is to use this powerful tool of women to promote Smartcash for massive adoption and usage in Ghana.\n",
            "description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sub Saharan Africa where Ghana forms part is the poorest in the world. Poverty in this part of the world keeps increasing at a scaring rate. This has formed part of many international developmental debates. The question that usually arises during these debates is why is sub Saharan Africa the poorest? Many of these debates have raised issues trying to address the situation, the key reason identified by many researchers on poverty in this part of the world is inequality. In Ghana, inequality still remains a major challenge and a troubling issue. Where women are marginalized and denied certain rights and opportunities, despite the international community&rsquo;s efforts to end this, the phenomenon still prevails. This trend has taken toe in every sphere of our economic and social lives, it can be manifested even in our leadership. There are 275 parliamentarians in the country, out of this 35 are women representing 13% of the legislature (https://www.parliament.gh/). There are 110 ministers of state in the country with only 29 of them being women (presidency.gov.gh/index.php/governance). This phenomenon has reflected in virtually every other aspect of our economy. This has greatly affected everything we do as a country. Women have been relegated to the backdrop.</p>\n<p>This project would demystify and break the chain of inequality in Ghana and empower women. Women will be selected from diverse fields, trained and empowered to take up leadership positions and roles. They will be taught investment and wealth creation, and they would be showed avenues in which they can leverage Smartcash as a source of income generation through speculative decisions and the use of smartRewards.</p>\n<p>Most of these women are traders, they buy their goods online and physically in many parts of world using fiat money. The risk involved in using this fiat money is enormous and therefore the need to adopt and use cryptocurrency and Smartcash in particular to transact. The training will be held in 3 regions of Ghana.</p>\n<p>Having successfully organize meetups in Ghana and having helped @Cryptowall in the current Smartcash Roadshow in Ghana, I have a strong conviction that this project is possible and necessary. Please click <a href=\"https://mmashud61.wixsite.com/website\">https://mmashud61.wixsite.com/website</a> or on facebook by searching MOHAMMED MASHUD KOFI to check.</p>\n<p><strong>Action Plan </strong></p>\n<p>All participants would be trained on how to set up Smartcash wallets and how they can promote it. Also ideas that can promote the currency will be brought up through our discussions. 20 participants from each region who demonstrate an excellent understanding of the block chain technology and Smartcash technology would be selected to serve as ambassadors for smartcash.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Event plan</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>15 minutes TV discussion on TV3&rsquo;s new day in Accra.</li>\n<li>20 minutes Radio presentation on Smartcash in all 3 regions.</li>\n<li>3 hours vigorous boothcamp on Smartcash for two days in a chosen venue in each region.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The breakdown of the Media interaction is as follows;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5 minutes training on the blockchain technology.</li>\n<li>5 minutes training on cryptocurrencies.</li>\n<li>5 minutes presentation on smartcash.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The breakdown of Boothcamp training is as follows;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Presentation on Blockchain technology.</li>\n<li>Presentation on Cryptocurrency with focus on Smartcash.</li>\n<li>Presentation on how to invest and trade using Smartcash.</li>\n<li>The need for women financial freedom and women leadership.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above breakdown will entail;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to download and activate smartcash wallets.</li>\n<li>Key features of Smartcash i.e. smart forums, smart rewards, smart voting, smart nodes etc.</li>\n<li>How to purchase/buy Smartcash from local and international exchanges via CoinExchange, HitBTC etc.</li>\n<li>Advantages of using Smartcash for daily transactions like buying goods online, paying for services, receiving remittances and many more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>$5 worth of SMART will be given to the first 50 participants in each region and the participants will be allowed to demonstrate a practical understanding of the training by making them send the tokens to each other.

            "description": "<p>I will keep this simple since its not a traditional funding proposal but more of a showing off how unique SmartCash truly is by suggesting we double SmartRewards this month with an airdrop the day before to the balance of an equal amount from the SmartHive Budget.</p>\n<p><strong>There are a few good reasons to do this which I will explain below:</strong></p>\n<p>-This would help remedy the OMG my smartnode didnt get its payout enough times for those who havent sold rewards or nodes because they would just have become eligible the past 2 months. Anyone who sold would be excluded due to moving funds out of the node and this is good for distribution to these folks in an anonymous and fair method.</p>\n<p>-Holders are proving some good support for us and had they dumped along with all the weak hands, crytopia coins, node reward sellers we would surely be headed even further downward, thus as a reward and a thank you to these folks I suggest this is heavily considered.</p>\n<p>- It would be a great story about our community and how much we value it, worthy or sharing quite a bit since it will roughly be a million dollar airdrop...</p>\n<p>- It will help with the longterm goal of onboarding long term minded people with the possibility of future creative thank yous. (not to set a precedent or anything, just seems like a no brainer atm..)</p>\n<p>- Its a big FU to the bear market. Shows SmartCash isnt just another shitcoin and makes a point about the things we can do that others cannot.</p>\n<p>- This will help reward those we know are NOT dumping compared to some of the recent proposals which cashed out on the way down. Which is fine but we should still reward those not dumping from time to time.</p>\n<p>- SmartRewards percentage keeps dropping hard due to quality holders, a bump here and there won't hurt and is the same thing a large financial entity would do in hard times IMO.</p>\n<p>-The fund is getting VERY large, this is a good first step towards decentralizing our economy a tad bit more.</p>\n<p>-The more funds our long term holders get the better our governance system works compared to people buying in for influence whether it be good or bad. People who understand the initial vision need to stick around and perpetuate it for years to come, this helps.</p>\n<p>-Gives us some great news... some positivity...</p>\n<p>-SmartRewards has proven very effective and this just adds to its glamour.</p>\n<p>-Helps ease the folks who have been buying at or above 20-60 cents and makes them more likely to hodl long term since we have thier needs in mind...</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I welcome all discussion on this but did not have time for a pre proposal as I want this to specifically happen in April as a way to punish node sellers and weak hands while also rewarding those who have held strong and stayed loyal. This idea may seem like a handout but I honestly think if we leverage it properly its very much going to pay off and be a thing we consider doing once a year or so when the budget gets larger and the situation arises...</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks everyone!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

            "summary": "The introduction of a pilot program for the people of Puerto Ordaz – Bolivar - Venezuela, in which they begin adopting the Smartcash Cryptocurrency to trade and buy goods and services, by introducing a physical exchange store where they can buy directly SMARTCASH with Venezuelan FIAT by trading with other people, and also work alongside with business owners of different categories (groceries, restaurants, healthcare, lodging, real state, tourism, house appliances, gold pawn shops, etc.,.) in order to provide the goods and services Payable with smartcash, all of this within the legal margins of Venezuelan Laws.",
            "description": "<p>Puerto Ordaz and industrialized city in Venezuela, presents itself as one of the richest cities in our country and in the near future the epicenter of an economic revolution due to its enormous wealth in its subsoil. Puerto Ordaz, the city where the first 3 conferences of smartcash crypto were held, now people are showing their interest in cryptocurrency not just smartcash, and are looking for means to buy it. We want to fill the void of information left after the conferences and continue to create awareness by providing the tools necessary to gain the public&rsquo;s trust and to help them get on the right path to start buying, saving and using the Smartcash Cryptocurrency.<br /><br />We begin by the introduction of a Legal Framework provided by a local firm of Accountants, Lawyers and Business Administrators. This group of professionals will deliver the legal grounds according to Venezuelan Tax and Banking laws in order to adopt SMARTCASH CRYPTO as a sort of payment, or to store value.<br /><br />Also with the help of the Chamber of Commerce Caroni we'll begin selecting and holding conferences with merchant enthusiasts about the implementation and adoption of SMARTCASH CRYPTO on each of their business. This also goes hand by hand with the common people, so that more and more people are integrated to the program. These conferences will address cryptocurrency basics, SMARTCASH benefits, legal framework and the use of the web exchanges and our own physical exchange!<br /><br />The introduction of the first physical exchange for Smartcash crypto, begins as a simplification of the process of buying the cryptocurrency, people will trade FIAT for SMARTCASH and other cryptos for SMARTCASH ONLY. It will function as a facilitator of the conversion and also as an escrow service, in order to gain people's trust and therefore be the first exchange of their choosing when it comes to buying and trading!&nbsp;<br /><br />In order to create awareness, we will also organize monthly charity events in low-income areas, hospitals and schools in the city of Puerto Ordaz that will provide food, clothing, medicines and healthcare with the collaboration of volunteers from the different colleges in the Puerto Ordaz area by financing community service projects proposals, also by including the people that will be part of this program thus projecting the smartcash community in puerto ordaz.<br /><br />Generate databases of all the &ldquo;users&rdquo; in the smartcash community at puerto ordaz, alongside performing data analytics and metrics to create Monthly reports (number of wallets opened since the beginning of the project, volume of smarts being traded through the exchange, types of stores and the goods and services mostly bought with smarts, users profiles) This will provide valuable information to perform better marketing strategies.<br /><br />Venezuela is facing very difficult times, shortage of food, biggest inflation in the world, restricted access to other currencies, etc. This is why we see potential in cryptocurrency specially an emerging one like SMARTCASH, because with all of its benefits it provides us the tools to shield in some level the situation we are facing and if done correctly, and by combining all of our efforts, we think that mass adoption of Smartcash in our city will be a fact. The business model created can be then implemented in other cities for further expansion.</p>\n<div class=\"regular contents\">\n<div class=\"cooked\">\n<p><strong>PROJECT UPDATE:</strong></p>\n<p>At first our team would like to apologize with the community for not showing any progress with this proposal. Circumstances outside our plans forced us to put aside the project&rsquo;s first milestones for a while. About a week ago we decided to get back on track, but, it came to our knowledge that because of the lack of communication with the Ambassador our project was taking down according to rules.</p>\n<p>This is why we ask you the fellow voters of this community give us again the opportunity to finish our project, for our commitment with the community still the same, as well as the smartcash community in our city. Allow me to say as well that our team did not receive a single smart from the project&rsquo;s original budget, even though we did make some expends to set things in motion, we are not asking for refunds.</p>\n<p>The only modification to the project is THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK and how it will be carried it out. In Venezuela. The problem we are facing now is the pseudo illegality of cryptocurrency in our country, illegality been created by the government and the introduction of the PETRO (a government issue cryptocurrency). What we&rsquo;re set to achieve is A LEGAL FRAMEWORK that proposes a different approach towards legality by introducing Academics, College professors and respected people of interest in certain business areas and promote public hearings for the creation of a Healthy Legal Framework for Cryptocurrencies in our country. For the actual dubious and unknown agenda set by the current government poses a threat to all cryptos in our country and might consider them all illegal.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

LOL.</p>\n<p>I was born in 1996, yes exactly when the web was popping up. So I grew up connected to the Internet(sometimes I think my parents ordered me online), older people used to tell me how it was in the ancient times when they only had radio, aerial tv, wired phones and offline computers(oh my gosh, I can&rsquo;t imagine an offline computer, diskettes??? What the heck is that??).</p>\n<p>My parents got divorced, so I had to work at the age of 14, one of my first jobs was in a tortilleria, yes that tiny and hot as hell store with a big machine to make tortillas, so the owner had one of those old &ldquo;multimedia computers&rdquo;, so I bought a modem, put it online, and make an Excel workbook to register the sales and a webcam so he can monitor his business, he fired me, true story.</p>\n<p>So, I love technology and its impact in the society. I&rsquo;m currently 22 years old and I deeply fell in love with the blockchain technology. I see many futuristic scenarios about how the blockchain will transform our world and our society. And you know what? Last year when I knew Smartcash I knew true love. I know that Smartcash has the potential to change the world entirely. The Smarthive concept is a piece of smart art. And I&rsquo;m really engaged with the roadmap.</p>\n<p>Currently I live in Cancun, in an ocenfront apartment and I administer 3 Airbnb properties, and you guessed, I have everything automated, well, almost everything, I haven&rsquo;t found my Rosie, the robot maid.</p>\n<p>I love to make videos, and I own several microphones, 3 gopro cameras, 1 360 camera, and several other kind of cameras, lights, a green screen, one drone and other gadgets. Sometimes I make **inspirational** videos or **documentary** videos like this one: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soG5f-YBfmg&amp;t=110s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soG5f-YBfmg&amp;t=110s</a> or this one: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJJIeWvCYEw&amp;t=29s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJJIeWvCYEw&amp;t=29s</a></p>\n<p>I enjoy travelling, I&rsquo;m passionate about sailing(I have a Hobie Getaway Sailboat), I&rsquo;m a gourmand and I want to help the blockchain technology change our world.</p>\n<p><br />You can find a **<strong>Detailed Budget</strong>** here: <a title=\"SmartCash Adventures Budget\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PJ09-WUO43XMrlSHN1VWCDK9u7BQmrDMAkALbEMTj4s/edit?ts=5ac32e1e#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Docs, Detailed Budget</a><br /><br />And a <strong>General Budget:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Qty Concept Amount</strong> <br /> <br />1 SmartCashAdventures.com Domain $0.0 <br />1 Web and Graphic Design $900.00 <br />125 Smartcash Tshirts $10.00 <br />4 Smartcash Hat $18.00 <br />12 Transportation Expenses per week $120.00 <br />1 Printed Material(Flyers and Stickers) $750.00 <br />24 Entrances to the Venues(Parks, Restaurants for the host and camera man) $125.00 <br />25 Video and Blog Post Production and Edition $135.00 <br />3 Montly Administration Camera Man $600.00 <br />3 Montly Administration Video Host $600.00</p>\n<p>TOTAL USD$14, 387.00</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://forum.smartcash.cc/t/smartcash-adventures-in-riviera-maya/3867\" alt=\"\" /></p>",

They will start with the SmartCash logo before diving into the material. At the end of the video, a feature of SmartCash will be mentioned and the viewers will be told that the top comment by the end of the week will earn $50 in SmartCash. This will encourage viewer engagement and get people creating SmartCash Wallets.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit to SmartCash</strong></p>\n<p>These videos allow SmartCash to get exposure to Smart people. People in these industries have the purchasing power to become serious investors and some of them may even represent the billion-dollar, institutional investors. Thanks to the last set of videos I had a Zoom call with an executive from Munich Re who was interested in SmartCash and Blockchain potential.</p>\n<p><strong>Budget</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marketing the videos: $800 ($100 per video)</li>\n<li>Creation of content:$4000 ($500 per video)</li>\n<li>Prize for Top Comments: $400 ($50 per video)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Total Amount: $5200</p>\n<p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p>\n<p>The aim is to get the first video out at the beginning of May and release one every week for the next two months.</p>\n<p>Each video's objective is to get 15000 views and a meaningful discussion in the comment section.</p>",

            "description": "<p># Who Am I</p>\n<p>I am a trained salesman, blogger, cryptocurrency ambassador, investor and trader. I was recently appointed ambassador for an Italian company. My duty will be to blog for them. Speaking of blog I started out in crypto through Steemit. I participated as a blogger on steemit in SmartCash's Ambassador Writing Contest. I am an early adopter of SmartCash who is passionate about offering my services.</p>\n<p><br /># Proposal</p>\n<p>See what I did there? I caught your attention! I did with that beautiful picture of that Jamaican! That is what marketing is supposed to do! Take a look at the following partial examples of ad marketing scripts/scene.</p>\n<p>1/. A woman sticks her chest and her butt out as she walks in heels with the hip swing full of confidence. As she strolls down the boardroom in her grey suit she holds a binder delicately by her fingertips. Her lips are deliciously highlighted with red matte lipstick. She slowly comes to a halt, turns to the centre desk, whips her hair back ever so seductively and reaches for an ice cold coca cola. <br />*music plays and she smiles after she finishes the can</p>\n<p>2/. It is a regular day for Josh. Josh is in his final year of university. He is a fat sloppy geek with no friends. His clothes are not stylish. He occasionally spills his lunch on himself, gets mocked, arrives late for lectures along with other bad stuff. As you probably guessed he does not have a girlfriend. Women freak out at the idea of him even accidentally saying hello. Josh gets enraged one day and rushes home, cries for days. A commercial comes on TV with a tenor pitched salesman:</p>\n<p>Salesman: \"Are you tires of being a loser?\"</p>\n<p>Josh: \"Yes!\"</p>\n<p>Salesman: \"Ignored?\"</p>\n<p>Josh: \"Yes!\"</p>\n<p>Salesman: \"Spilling your lunch all the time?\"</p>\n<p>Josh: \"Yes yes!\"</p>\n<p>Salesman: \"Can't attract beautiful women?\"</p>\n<p>Josh: \"That's ME! YES ME!\"</p>\n<p>Salesman: \"Well friend Tiege Hanley makes you 'The Boss'. Dial the number on your screen right now and get SAME DAY delivery.. \"</p>\n<p>Next day he's driving a McLaren, gold diggers flirting with him and cooler guys are hanging around. He is now 'The Boss'. <br />*a James Bond soundtrack plays right as he looks to the camera and says<br />\"I wear Tiege Hanley\", with a deep smooth voice.</p>\n<p>**THE END**</p>\n<p>I want to do a mini four-week campaign with ads in the Gleaner, Star and Observer newspapers for smart cash. I choose these three because they are the most popular read newspapers by Jamaicans here and abroad. The impact will not only reach a large fraction of my audience but also be cost-effective. Jamaicans sum up around 4-5.5 million people. Newsprint receives at least one million reads monthly.</p>\n<p>Newsprints can bring large inflows of new adoption to SmartCash causing price to rocket off to new highs. This will be beneficial to the crypto sphere and long term vision for SmartCash. To consume as little time as possible I will hire a marketing agency who will create the advertisements. The greater advantage of a marketing agency will be effective use of emotional triggers to pull in the readers, hence converting them to investors.</p>\n<p>The motive of this campaign is to increase awareness of SmartCash and simultaneously set the stage for part 2 of my proposal. PART 2 will include radio interviews. Reason being I will then begin to turn the public spotlight. It will be easier to identify with because some people would have already been familiar with it thus, enhancing reach and strengthen confidence of new investors.</p>\n<p>Do you know what it is like to buy something, become passionate about it, then look like a big fat idiot when you get let down? I do! I want my investors to feel smart. I want people to start renaming social media profiles to include $smart. I want to have the early investors bragging about EVERYTHING! Making friends curious, zealous, jealous, on their smart devices researching this coin and dropping social media posts about it. Secondly I am able to get advertising discounts or bundle advertising from The Gleaner Company.<br />[The Gleaner Newspaper](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/)<br />[The Observer Newspaper](http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/)<br />[The Star Newspaper](http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/)</p>\n<p>![89D8eeiU|500x500](upload://kjb3Fn46ZDGcxMBzqIcyiAf24gT.jpg)![srqBnscL_400x400|400x400](upload://5FcalzAh5BP0yCDLlX9ZtmvnMzV.jpg)![AR-170429893|504x332](upload://lmh1LEJHI2mG8ZTQr5pyJKKdEaq.jpg)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p># Details of My Advertising</p>\n<p>The advert will contain links to:<br />&bull; Instruction on buying bitcoin<br />&bull; [Smart Cash's website](smartcash.cc)<br />&bull; A video explaining Smart Cash and how to get some (sample below)<br />http://youtu.be/j8YeNr5MY6A</p>\n<p>*a screenshot of the quote from The Observer Advertising Agency is below*</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>![Screenshot_2018-03-23-21-24-31|300x500](upload://ogg6urQWQTNVOKPX7n8KCLo1WUe.png)</p>\n<p><br /># Why not social media which is cheaper? <br />![social-media|690x460](upload://5cAoZJEhsGDzfnhdSbVYG9N2wLE.jpg)</p>\n<p>If I were to suggest a seemingly cheaper solution let is take 'cheaper' into context.</p>\n<p>Facebook, Twitter and Google have banned cryptocurrency advertising. The form of ads they use is digital banners. I remember running an ad campaign last September for a crypto. It was fairly cheap and I could reach 220k people on just $250 with Facebook. Keep in mind cryptocurrency is not an easily caught on subject.</p>\n<p>**Twitter** is where some of the excitement happens. The thing is most of the investors in my target audience do not use Twitter. Even if they did, the last place to go learn something as comes as cryptocurrency is there! Most Jamaicans rather follow our Dancehall Kings and Queens, watch Usain Bolt play football or keep up with local politics and business. Although most of us here are tech savvy and intelligent to the stars so much so we can plan the grandest of entrepreneurial ventures I will not choose Twitter. Simply put it too much noise.</p>\n<p>**Google** is good tool for locating but not advertising. All cryptocurrency advertising is banned. Besides Google there is Duck Duck Go, Bing and Yahoo. Nevertheless I'll leave the web ads solely up to the SmartCash team.</p>\n<p>So what will work then?</p>\n<p>A little more research proves the following for digital ads:</p>\n<p>According to page 11 in Friendz SRL white paper *\"615 Million devices block irritating and useless info across the globe, more and more people are deploying ad blocking software on their phones. 50% Of clicks on mobile ads were made by mistake(source: GoldSpot Media); It is more likely to survive an airplane disaster than to click on a banner (source: Solve Media).\"*<br />[Friendz SRL white paper](https://friendz.io/file/whitepaper_icofriendz.pdf)</p>\n<p>What my fellow country men need is a more accented approach. The good old newspaper is way better than social media, and cheaper <br />in proportion to generating genuine prospects. Social media is simply lacking the benefits of interpersonal communication, controlled flow of interpretation and the feel of tradition which is more quintessential. Demonstrating how SmartCash will caters to my target audience is what should start pulling attention. Who says testimonials are our friend? You say right! Even newspaper ads can have these.</p>\n<p>The newspaper has the ability to save on time while building interest and gossip about the new era of money. Even 3% of the population between ages 18 and 34 would be good traction, am I right? While I could decide to target all readers, millennials are flexible and avid.</p>\n<p>*How accessible is the newspaper?*</p>\n<p>- As accessible as a stick of gum. They're located in auto parts shops &amp; stores, at appliance stores, by sidewalk vendors, the stadiums, wholesales, most bus terminals, taxi parks, gas &amp; service stations, etc. These three newspaper brands: The Star, The Gleaner and The Observer are most times available. These companies dominate 88% of printed media advertising. 80% of Jamaican workplaces has at least one copy of each daily paper available for employees and at least 20% of employees read the paper when bored, eating lunch and having a break. According to a local poll *14% of people who use the newspaper daily make a purchase, access a service or are planning to do so. 54% of readers fall between 18-34. And 86% users who made a purchase of accesses a service did so thru an advertisement. As of 2018 over one million people read the paper in Jamaica only every month.* Approximately 540,000 are in my DIRECT target range. The newspaper is a great investment?</p>\n<p>However when I think of all the managers, executives, diplomats, politicians and many other influential people reading the paper I shiver at the amount of potential converts who could be Smarties like you and I today. If just one influential person was to begin using Smart Cash the entire Caribbean would want to join in! What if my man Usain Bolt makes a tweet?</p>\n<p>\"Smart Cash is amazing. I sent $1mil with a $1000 fee. Everyone should use it\".</p>\n<p>By allowing me to put everything in place for smart cash, other Caribbean nations will begin to hear of the revolution and get jealous excited or whatever is in the sea of intrigue to feel. And since my country is the leader here in the Caribbean must we act quickly to capture and convert others before Bitcoin, Bread App, Zen Cash (who already hurt us badly and given us a bloody nose), Stellar Lumens (maybe), but most importantly Ripple (XRP) which is being tested by remittances here for mid-2019 release. Do you think if we pass up this window of opportunity that the bankers will care?</p>\n<p>Do you think that Money Gram, Western Union, Lasco Cambio, Victoria Mutual and every other remittance will give a sh*t?!</p>\n<p>As someone who understands human psychology I can tell you that most people here will be loyal to the first only one to take them as a convert. We need this territory conquered before some other cryptocurrency attempts cementing their presence.</p>\n<p>I have been into marketing of various community level events locally and online. I know how to make an impact. I helped organize severally camps, publicity campaigns and sales pitches for professionals. I will make smart cash great in Jamaica. I normally have a 70% success rate in sales and sligtly higher on my marketing projects. It will be fun working to make something such as a new currency the next widely accepted norm overtime.</p>\n<p>Everything will be colourful, easy to follow, emotionally attractive and leaving a call to action for the prospective reader to follow-up with. SmartCash.cc needs a push notification service set up [Update: Based on my recommendation a push notification service with Opt-in was set up in Discord].</p>\n<p>**How will people see a newspaper and choose us?**</p>\n<p>I understand there are hundreds of other ads against us. Attention spans is not our friend. That is why I'll deploy some of the most powerful to the sneakiest psychological marketing techniques to ensure we capture the readers and convert them into active adopters. With that said time for the budget.</p>\n<p>![Making-A-Monthly-Budget|690x361](upload://b1jSNwK5vXFdKDOxa8alcuvcfQS.png)</p>\n<p>*Size of the ad, class and page of the advertisements have been calculated to decide total combined costs.*</p>\n<p>Combined costs of newspaper ads - $15,837.50</p>\n<p>Hire Marketing agency - $2,680</p>\n<p>Personal Expenses - $1100</p>\n<p>**Total - $19,617.50 / 392,350 SMART**</p>\n<p>**Personal Expenses** covers the following:</p>\n<p>&bull; Cost of transport</p>\n<p>&bull; Research and planning I will do to make the advertising successful in accomplishing everything</p>\n<p>&bull;Additional research and preparation for a follow up campaign</p>\n<p>&bull; My skill set utilized by Smart Cash.</p>\n<p>This budget should cover all the expenses of the one month campaign.

            "description": "<p><strong>&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</strong></p>\n<p>Dear all,</p>\n<p>Alhassan Abdul Wadud <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptosoja\">https://twitter.com/cryptosoja</a> is my name known on the smartcash community as cryptosoja. A crypto advocate who believe smartcash is the future of payments. I have supported cryptotravelers in advocating cryptocurrency through meet ups and conferences under the umbrella of our free markets and liberty think tank. Due to the increasing adoption of cryptocurrency in Africa and with the passion and enthusiasm I have for smartcash and as part of my efforts to inflate the adoption and usage of smartcash, I am proposing a program: INTRODUCING SMARTCASH TO SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS IN GHANA. This project intern to run in partnership with<strong> DREAM BIG FOUNDATION</strong> <a href=\"https://web.facebook.com/DREAM-BIG-Foundation-1210131202401498/\">https://web.facebook.com/DREAM-BIG-Foundation-1210131202401498/</a><strong>. </strong>Gradually cryptocurrency adoption in Africa is taking root at an admirable pace. However, one of the relevant areas that need a big push is the educational sector to accept and understand the relevance of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and smartcash. This is very essential since, that will boost the adoption and offer Africans the freedom and comfort stations to these currencies and Ghana is one of the African countries where cryptocurrency adoption is picking up massively. Therefore the proposal intends to introduce smartcash to secondary schools in Ghana and make a target of 4-5 secondary schools within a period of a month with the development of interest and the acceptance of smartcash by secondary schools, since we need schools to understand the relevance of cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and smartcash as a means of payment which is easy, fast and can be processed immediately. For the first time this initiative will be introduce into the country, to introduce smart to secondary schools in Ghana will help expand the smartcash frontier and the increment of smartcash usability in Ghana. This project is aimed at introducing Smartcash to students in the secondary level in Ghana. The reason is to educate them on the importance of youth savings as a means of creating access to and a key link between economic opportunities and outcomes for young people and enabling them to manage emergencies, invest in their education as well as improve their future orientation.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT WE INTERNT TO DO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>We intend to organize a meet up with the secondary schools across the country within a period a months to discuss the relevance and uses of the blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and smartcash. The reason being that, until a number of schools start to understand the relevant and importance of smartcash as a future of money which will soon replace the fiat currency in the near future as payment of goods and services, that smartcash can now be fully recognize for the purpose of it creation</li>\n<li>Also All participants will be trained on the blockchain technology, Smartcash, how to download and setup Smartcash wallets, key features of Smartcash, how to purchase Smartcash from local and international exchanges, and the advantages of using Smartcash for their daily transactions worldwide for the payment goods and services, payment of fees/bills, receiving remittances and many more. Students will therefore be encouraged to use their savings to purchase Smartcash to accumulate capital and wealth using Smartcash and SmartRewards as store of capital in the long term to realize their entrepreneurial goals.</li>\n<li>We intern to print smart manual guide for beginners in this ecosystem. hold meet ups with teachers of the selected schools and educate them on smartcash.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One on one meeting with principals, headmasters/headmistress and school staffs as well</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>A radio talk show will be held in each region to create public awareness within the region.

The program would last for three months and 12 secondary schools would be tackled at the end of the program.

            "description": "<p><strong>CREATING SMART JOURNALISTS UNION (S.J.U)</strong></p>\n<p><br /><strong>Summary</strong><br />Nigeria being one of the African Nations with the highest population is filled with alot of unbanked citizens who lack trust for government controlled institutions . With only a few of the country&rsquo;s citizens being aware of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, it is a great opportunity to increase the awariness, adoption, acceptance and follwership of smartcash in this Nation.</p>\n<p>I being the chairman of the Nigerian Union of Women Journalists , Kaduna State Chapter; intend to introduce journalists to decentralization and cryptocurrency through conferences and workshops; laying huge emphasis on the adoption of cryptocurrency using Smartcash to site examples.</p>\n<p>With journalists who are key players in the dissemination of information in the scene, it won&rsquo;t take long before Nigeria is turned into a Smartcash Nation with a huge amount of its populace being aware of cryptocurrency and having Smartcash being the first cryptocurrency they bought.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective</strong><br />The core objective of this proposal is to create mass awareness for Smartcash in Nigeria by holding three (3) conferences and workshops in three Nigerian states which are mainly centered on journalists (and other press personnels) who would in turn write and publish articles about Smartcash in various media.</p>\n<p>We will be setting up a Smartcash Journalists Union in each state, and these union will be made up of various types of press personnels ranging from news-caster, journalists to bloggers. Members of this union will be given the duty of promoting Smartcash through various press mediums.</p>\n<p><strong>How we intend to achieve this</strong><br />I and my team will be holding three (3) conferences and three (3) workshops in three different Nigerian states. These conference will be held in each state&rsquo;s capital which is usually populated by highly educated, intelligent and influential iindividuals whose adoption of Smartcash will make huge difference. Amongst these individuals are lawyers, engineers, doctors, journalists, etc.</p>\n<p>These conferences will be centered on journalists and other press personnels in the state. During each conference we will be encouraging these journalists to contribute their quota to the betterment of the country by promoting cryptocurrency which ensures freedom and full participation in the nation&rsquo;s financial decisions.</p>\n<p>After each conference in each state we will have journalists who whole heartedly accepted to make the shift from fiat currency to cryptocurrency (Smartcash) write and publish cryptocurrency related articles centered on Smartcash through various media which include Print, Online, TV and Radio broadcast and also follow up on Smartcash community on Twitter, Telegram and Discord.</p>\n<p>A Smartcash Journalists Union (S.J.U) will be setup in each state, in which each will have a chairman who leads the union towards the goals of Smartcash. Each subset of the Union in the conquered states will hold one workshop every three months to imtroduce new individuals to the Smartcash community and the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole.</p>\n<p>I and my team will be making an introductory smartcash handbook for newbies; this handbook is geared towards explaining what cryptocurrency is and why it&rsquo;s adoption is important and simplified information on the features of Smartcash and how to be part of the Smartcash community.</p>\n<p>The Smartcash handbook and some other souvenirs such as Smartcash T-shirts, Pen, and Jotters will be shared in these conferences to increase non-verbal adverts outside the conference room .</p>\n<p><strong>Project Kick-off and Duration</strong><br />We intend to start work immediately this proposal is aproved, currently we are working on the Smartcash handbook which contains basic subjects on Smartcash.</p>\n<p>This project is to be embarked on for three months, which means we will be concentrating on one state per/month.</p>\n<p>We intend to start with Kaduna state which happens to be one of the states with the largest landmark and population as well. Kaduna State has a population of 6.3 million people with about 60% being civil servants who are tired of the inflation of the country&rsquo;s currency and corruption of the government and so seek other means to secure their financial futures.</p>\n<p>Next we will be taking on Katsina state, a state which has a population of 6.7 million people and happens to be the border to Niger Republic and other nations.</p>\n<p>Lastly we will be having the last conference in Lagos state. This is a state which used to be the country&rsquo;s Federal Capital Territory. With most of the locals unbanked and highly learned, it is a fertile soil to plant Smartcash as the number one cryptocurrency of the people where all is fair.</p>\n<p><strong>Who is Coin-fairy</strong><br />Coin-fairy is a journalist, cryptocurrency enthusiast and fashion designer who bought her first cryptocurrency (bitcoin) in the third quarter of 2016 and ever since has clung to the idea of financial freedom and transparency which cryptocurrency promises.</p>\n<p>Since 2016, she has dedicated part of her time researching and advocating for the adoption of cryptocurrency. She has been able to convince a couple of store owners to accept bitcoin in her community so she can be totally unbanked.</p>\n<p>She is also the chairman of Nigerian Association of Women Journalists, Kaduna State Chapter. An association filled with vibrant women journalists who write for various renowned media houses across Nigeria and abroad.</p>\n<p><strong>Why I chose Smartcash</strong><br />Since my discovery and adoption of cryptocurrency, I have researched and used a handful of cryptocurrencies and almost all of them seemed to be the same with only those who have huge amounts of the coin being the only ones with the voice but once I discovered Smartcash everything changed.</p>\n<p>My love for Smartcash grew after I bought my first Smartcash and participated in the voting of some proposals. Knowing that everyone in the community has a voice and opinion that is respected no matter the amount of Smartcash you have in your wallet made me want to be part of its community as well as contribute my quota to its goal and overall success.</p>\n<p><strong>My Team</strong><br />My team is made up of five highly educated cryptocurrency lovers and adoption activists. Amongst them are; a programmer, an engineer and three journalists who write for renowned media houses in Nigeria.</p>\n<p>Each person in my team became aware and adopted cryptocurrency during my little workshops which I have had a handful of with about 40-50 people present in each.</p>\n<p><strong>Validation</strong><br />To validate the progress of this project, I and my team will be uploading reports, pictures and other evidence on the Smartcashdiscord server which will validate the amount of work being done by I and my Team</p>\n<p><strong>Budget Breakdown</strong><br />Kaduna State, Katsina state and Lagos state<br />Conference Room = $500<br />Advert = $50<br />Sound = $210<br />Alternative Power. = $200<br />Photo coverage = $180<br />Souvenirs (Smartcash pen, handbook and t-shirt) = $1400<br />Pull-up = $70<br />Banner = $50<br />Graphic Design. = $100<br />Transportation (5 persons) = $250<br />Accommodation (5 persons) = $1000<br />Feeding (5 persons) = $120<br />Team bounty. = $1250<br />Subtotal = $5,381<br />Contingency = $600<br /><strong>Total</strong>. = $5, 981</p>",

A web developer and skilled in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, PHP, ANGULAR and NODE!</p>\n<p><strong>What Problem is this Solving?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Utility Problem:</em><br /> There are few known ways to easily use smartcash online or anywhere. Smart Cash will aggregate and recruit SmartCash-accepting businesses into one easy-to-use online shopping marketplace.</p>\n<p><em>Trader&rsquo;s game:</em><br /> The idea of dumping an asset when it&rsquo;s price in btc or usd appreciates is the trader&rsquo;s game at the detriment of the SmartCash Owner, Holders and the entire hive. Merchant Map will create an avenue for SmartCash holders and other crypto users who wish to user their assets to purchase quality goods and services from reputable businesses in their region.</p>\n<p><em>BTC barrier</em><br /> SmartCash holders who want to desire to use their asset for products and services will have to sell(or better DUMP) it for bitcoin. At this point SmartCash becomes a non-entity., it also means the true owners of the asset are traders who bid on the pride for their own selfish gain. This barrier is broken as smartcash will be exchanged with people who could exchange it for products or services thereby by passing the route to exchanges. This will create an organic growth model and will support and build local economies around SmartHive, thus scaling demand for SmartCash.</p>\n<p><strong>Benfits to the Community</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Merchant Adoption</em>:&nbsp;SmartCash&rsquo;s Merchant Map will serve as a comprehensive global directory of businesses accepting Smart Cash. It will also serve as a resource, including how-to guides, tips and tricks, and other information to support our growing economy.</li>\n<li><em>Utility</em>: Merchant Map answers the &ldquo;What can I use it for&rdquo; Question. Everyone who has organized a meet up for smart cash or introduced it to friends have been thrown such question before. Merchant Map provides a way for Smart Holders to exchange their assets for various products and service thereby increasing the value of SmartCash.</li>\n<li><em>Deflating the Bubble</em>: Merchant Map removes SmartCash from the hands of traders to real users. Users exchange coins for value and not for BTC or Dollar. The idea of dumping an asset when it&rsquo;s price in btc or usd appreciates is the trader&rsquo;s game at the detriment of SmartCash Owner, Holders and the entire hive.</li>\n<li><em>Payment Solution</em>: Merchant Map includes an online POS which enables merchants to receive payments into a specified address. This makes Merchant map not only a directory of merchants but an online solution for payment of goods and services.</li>\n<li><em>Awareness</em>: Merchant map increases SmartCash awareness and brand recognition. As users share their shops on various media, smart cash is indirectly advertised.</li>\n<li><em>Increased merchant interest</em>: Merchant map creates a market for merchants to attract more customers globally with their products and services, this cuts down the cost of marketing as Merchant map markets products in its directory to users.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Visual and functional objectives include</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A clean, modern design</li>\n<li>Prominently display SmartCash branding with useful links to learn more about SmartCash</li>\n<li>Easy merchant setup, operation and maintenance.</li>\n<li>Merchant pages setup and maintenance (e.g. add/remove products and change prices/availability).</li>\n<li>Merchant order receipt and payment.</li>\n<li>Customer-Friendly Features.</li>\n<li>Product/Service search integration.</li>\n<li>Merchant ratings and review.</li>\n<li>Customer support</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How Will Merchant Map Accomplish This? [Strategy]</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Agents</em>&nbsp;: Merchant Map will work with agents. After completing the Merchant Map Agent registration and training (Just a PDF outlining terms and work specification). Agents are required to spread the word all-over the world. Organizing meet-ups and helping our merchant list grow daily.<br /> Bounties will be given to recruit and on-board established, reputable businesses to merchant map as well as every other task and this role is available to anyone in the community.</li>\n<li>There will be a qualification and approval process for each merchant, with a maximum of two bounties available for each product category to attract a diverse mix of products and services available. Each bounty will be worth up to 50$. This will put our vast community to work, resulting in a &ldquo;win-win-win&rdquo; for SmartCash.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Promotional Campaign</strong><br /> As part of our marketing program, a targeted advertising will be conducted on popular platforms such as Facebook, twitter and Reddit. Every Merchant who registers within the first 2 Months of Operation gets $100/per category. Free Marketing/Advertisement for brands on our social media handles.<br /> <br /> Merchant Meet up Campaign<br /> In order to get as much merchants on-board, merchant map will organize a meet up program. This meet-ups are geared towards recruiting merchants alone and bounties will be given to agents (anyone in the community) to host such merchant events. The purpose of this meet-up is to introduce as much merchants as possible. Bounty will be given as follows. Bounties will be given to agents who organize such meet-ups</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong><br /> We estimate a timeline of approximately 9 weeks from project start-up to site publication.

And we have long experience distributing and brewing beer. I don&rsquo;t want to focus in our beer experience, but with 10 years in the business, we really know what we are talking about.</p>\n<p><strong>What will we do?</strong></p>\n<p>We want to create the first crypto beer, the <strong>Smartcash Beer</strong>. We are doing this because it puts together our two deep passions, Cryptocurrencies and Beer.</p>\n<p>We really want to focus in Smartcash adoption, but so far, apart from flyers, stickers or T-shirts, we don&rsquo;t find a real product created by the Smartcash community.</p>\n<p>Step 1: We'll brew 100 boxes of 24 beers of a delicious Pale Ale to start up, maybe we can add other kinds of beer, a wheat beer, a porter beer or other styles in the future in case we and the community want to extend this proposal.</p>\n<p>The beer is going to have a nice label design with the Smartcash logo, the beer information(AVB %, Style: Pale Ale Beer, etc) and the legend &ldquo;Not for Sale&rdquo; and the legend (Smart)2 Give Away and the legend, limited to 1 beer per client. So the beer is free, and if you get it you&rsquo;ll get 2 Smarts. The back part of the label also states the main information about Smartcash.</p>\n<p>Step 2: We&rsquo;d distribute some of the beer with the Smarcash communities in Mexico, so far in Guadalajara and Cancun, and we&rsquo;ll distribute the rest in local bars in Queretaro and Cancun where we have local presence.</p>\n<p>The beer will be free, we won&rsquo;t charge a dime to any restaurant or bar, because is already paid by the SmartHive budget, that&rsquo;s why the beer will have the legend &ldquo;Not for Sale&rdquo;, we&rsquo;ll give the beer for free but we&rsquo;ll ask the businesses to put a Sticker with the &ldquo;Smartcash Accepted Here&rdquo; legend, and we&rsquo;ll teach them everything about Smartcash, explain them its features and the benefits of staking Smartcash, there will be&nbsp; 2 Smarts per beer as a give away.<strong> People</strong> will have to publish their Smarcash address in the Spanish <strong>Telegram</strong> group, so we'll send them 2 Smarts.</p>\n<p>This way,&nbsp; we'll have restaurants and bars accepting Smartcash, we'll get people(consumers) that will learn about Smartcash, they will install a wallet, and they will receive 2 Smarts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll encourage the <strong>bars and restaurants</strong> to <strong>promote</strong> that they have free <strong>Smartcash</strong> beer in their business <strong>in social media platforms</strong>, so they can attract more clients, they benefit, the end consumer benefits and more and more people will know and use Smartcash, more wallets and the community grows.</p>\n<p><strong>We think this is a great way, that people can see(and drink) the real power of Smartcash.</strong></p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll print flyers and stickers and publish in <strong>Steemit in English and Spanish</strong> a report of what we are doing and the business participating, we might record <strong>videos</strong> in the bars with people drinking Smartcash and showing their wallets.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a big an important Beer expo(<a href=\"http://www.cervezamexico.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Cerveza Mexico</a>) and Beer Contest in Mexico in October, and who knows, we'll get our Smartcash beer into the competition. The first cryptobeer in a contest.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.copacerveza.mx/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Copa Cerveza Mexico</a>&nbsp;It has widely press coverage. I&rsquo;m sure Smartcash beerm the first Crypto beer,&nbsp; it will get the media attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Deliverables and Goals:</strong></p>\n<p>2400 Smartcash Beers<br />2,000 persons added to the community and in the telegram group<br />60 new business accepting Smartcash</p>\n<p><strong>Timeframe:&nbsp;</strong>We need 22 days to brew beer and have it ready. Yes it takes so long, it's high quality craft beer, fermented 3 weeks,&nbsp; &nbsp;and some styles could take much longer.</p>\n<p>While the beer is fermenting, we'll print the boxes, flyers and labels we need. We'll bottle the beer in a day,&nbsp; and we'll start the Smartcash evangelization with our promotional beer, next day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, once we have our Smartcash brews, we'll distribute them and we'll talk with the restaurants and bars, so they can start accepting Smartcash,and&nbsp; put the \"Smartcash accepted here\" in their windows. We are planning to do this during&nbsp; 3 weeks. We have experience distributing beers and we know many bars and restaurants owners.</p>\n<p>People will start joining the telegram group and publishing their wallet address so they can receive 2 Smarts. Once people knows about Smartcash, joined the telegram group and have Smartcash in their wallets, many of them will get more interested.</p>\n<p>We'll report our actions bothn in the telegram group and in Steemit.</p>\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why just don't&nbsp; sell the beer instead of giving it for free?</strong></p>\n<p>We won't sell the beer because it's not a bussiness, beer it's a promotional product and I think it could gain media attention. The Smarthive and community budget will pay for the beer. And We'll give it for free, but people will have to download a wallet and undertand how Smartcash works. If we sell the beer it's harder to ask people to learn about a crypto-what?. They paid for the beer, so they want to be bothered.</p>\n<p><strong>There's a 5 Smarts Give away. What will do if some Smarts are not claimed?<br /><br /></strong>In order to claim Smarts people will have to publish their address in the telegram group. So the community will know if we have Smarts left, and we think will do. So we'll set a date of&nbsp; 8 weeks to claim your Smarts. After that period of time, we'll convert the Smarts to Fiat and we'll give goods behalf Smartcash Global Community to a <strong>Charity Institution</strong>. We'll take pictures and report it in Telegram and Steemit.</p>\n<p><strong>BUDGET<br /><br /></strong>2400 Bottles of High Quality Crafted Pale Ale Beer. 2400 x $2.50 =USD$6,000.00</p>\n<p>100 Smartcash T shirts for the waitress and the crew. 100xUSD$10= USD$1,000.00</p>\n<p>Printed Material, flyers and stickers 1x USD$850 = USD$850.00</p>\n<p>Transportation Costs 1 x USD$350.00</p>\n<p>Administration Costs Crew(3). 3 x USD$600 = USD$1,800.00</p>\n<p>4800 Smarts for the Give Away. 4800XUSD$0.18 =$864.00</p>\n<p><br />TOTAL USD$10,864.00</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>You want to know mor about us?</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Who are We?:</strong></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.smartcash.cc/u/juanjo2012/summary\">@juanjo2012</a>, I&rsquo;m computer&rsquo;s engineer and I&rsquo;m so passionate about the technology, but I&rsquo;m also a beer brewer and I co-founded an e-commerce(I love e-commerce) website to sell everything to brew beer at a small scale(brewmasters.com.mx).

That is, massive adoption and usability.</li>\n<li>Adding&nbsp;<strong>1000plus</strong>&nbsp;well informed members to the SmartCash Network through our outreach programs. Great people that will form great teams and contribute towards SmartCash massive adoption.</li>\n<li><strong>1000</strong>&nbsp;SmartCash wallets will be created &amp; more than 20 merchants and businesses accepting SmartCash payments and listed on SmartCash merchant directory, making it as a &ldquo;cryptocurrency with utility&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;speculative asset&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>Increase the transaction volume of SmartCash in Ghana through our exchanges. If the users know SmartCash, get their first SMART through our giveaways, buy SmartCash through our local exchange platform&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ebitcoinics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ebitcoinics.com</a>, start to use it and businesses progressively start to accept it. We will manage an ecosystem of which allows a constant flow of capital which will benefit the quotation of SmartCash.</li>\n<li>Expand our outreach programs to other parts of the country and beyond, our target is to reach out to all universities in Ghana and also collect invaluable data on how young people adapt to SmartCash and spread information about SmartCash. We have observed that people show a lot interest in crypto but don&rsquo;t know which best option to start with. SmartCash provides a better option for everyone.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>PROBLEM</strong><br /><strong>Utility</strong>: In Ghana, there have been significant efforts from successful initiatives to promote the SmartCash adoption making more than 2000 new users download their wallets and get tokens. However, we look with concern that the number of users has an exponential growth, while the number of merchants or businesses where they can spend to obtain goods and services grows very slowly, being unbalanced the user-merchants ratio. With most Cryptocurrencies seen primarily as a &ldquo;speculative asset&rdquo; and a store of value, SmartCash is well positioned to establish itself as a medium of exchange considering the fees and fast transaction speed compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Awareness and Adoption</strong>: Notwithstanding our best efforts to get SmartCash to everyone in Ghana, the majority of Ghanaians are still unaware of SmartCash and the cryptocurrency revolution that is taking speed throughout Africa. People of Africa need everything decentralized. Blockchain has the potential to give the public greater control over their data- and to help them earn money whenever their information is used. Many will therefore demand SmartCash for their transactions as it solves numerous problems with their national currency, including portability, security, and inflation.</p>\n<p><strong>VALIDATION</strong><br />We did a market research which shows that almost 90% of merchants would be willing to accept SmartCash only if they have enough information about how to use it and the legal aspect. Also, about 60% to 90% of the Ghanaian population has still not heard of Bitcoin and SmartCash respectively. We will teach them about these issues, and also train them massively as merchant and Outreach Ambassadors across the country.</p>\n<p><strong>OUR SOLUTION</strong><br />Getting merchants and businesses to accept SmartCash is an arduous process in countries, however, providing them with the appropriate information through a professional and nearby institution that can provide them with support. They need the technical, financial, legal, accounting and tax advice to accept SmartCash as a payment method in their businesses. With merchants ready to seek alternative payment solutions we believe we can convince a significant number of merchants and businesses to accept SmartCash. This will generate massive press coverage about ways in which SmartCash is being used as a utility rather than a &ldquo;speculative asset&rdquo;, further accelerating its adoption, and empowering them to gain financial freedom against excessive government control.</p>\n<p>To achieve our goal of seeing SmartCash accepted as a utility by businesses, merchants, etc. there should be massive cryptocurrency advocacy to cover as many people as possible. This means encouraging more wallets downloads and installations of SmartCash functionality apps. Like most African nations, Ghana has a huge interest in cryptocurrency, with Google search data showing the country, along with other African nations, regularly topping the list for Bitcoin enquiries. The more SmartCash users there are and the better informed they are, the more pressure there will be on merchants to start accepting SmartCash as a means of payment.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT WE PLAN TO DO</strong><br />In this project we shall be working around the clock to expand our outreach to more Universities/Colleges as well as businesses to provide to them reasons to accept SmartCash as means of payment. We want to create a simple and easy platform for hundreds of businesses in Ghana which will bring together operators of restaurants, hotels ,gas stations, estate agencies, travels and tours ,supermarkets, car rentals ,online shops to start accepting SmartCash as a method of payment for goods and services. Also an intensive education on SmartCash, how to set up SmartCash wallets, how to accept SmartCash as payment using designed printed SmartCash POS in a form of printed SmartCash QR codes or using SmartCard in future, and how SmartCash can be of great benefit to their businesses. We shall undertake the following activities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Organize Monthly Regional Conference/Workshop in each region (Eastern Region, Volta region and Greater Accra Region) to inform, educate and increase mass adoption campaign for SmartCash in that jurisdiction through their educational institutions (Universities and Colleges). Our target is to reach out to 6 universities/Colleges, 2 from each region.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Organize Merchant/Business Adoption workshops in every region that would help recruit more Merchant, and get more businesses involved to accept SmartCash as means of payment in their outlets using the designed printed SmartCash POS in a form of printed SmartCash QR codes or using the SmartCard in future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Training of SmartCash Business Ambassadors to reach out to many businesses as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Radio discussion about SmartCash Cryptocurrency that would spread to people in the locality from principal media houses in the region. The radio program will be heard by about 45,000 people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will also ask merchants/businesses to accomplish some requirements. If they complete the following list, we will give them a &ldquo;training tip&rdquo; of 10$ in SmartCash:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Put the &ldquo;SmartCash Accepted here&rdquo; sticker in their business.</li>\n<li>Post on their social media that they are accepting SmartCash.</li>\n<li>List their business in the SmartCash merchant directory.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Referral Strategy:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Every merchant will win 10 points for each merchants they refer to us.</li>\n<li>When they get 50 points (5 referred merchants) they will win $15 worth SmartCash.</li>\n<li>In this way we will reach more merchants with less effort.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Plan B;</strong> For bigger shops like Melcom Gh&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melcom\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melcom</a>&nbsp;, Accra Mall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shoprite.com.gh/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.shoprite.com.gh/</a>&nbsp;, Marina Mall&nbsp;<a href=\"http://marinamallghana.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://marinamallghana.com/</a>&nbsp;Kumasi City Mall&nbsp;<a href=\"http://kumasicitymall.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://kumasicitymall.com/</a>&nbsp;etc. who may still not be ready to accept SmartCash as payment, we will create a merchant point in front of these shops where people can quickly exchange their SmartCash to Fiat to purchase goods and services at these shops.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All these will create a platform for SmartCash users to spend their SmartCash at the nearest coffee shop, restaurant, hotel etc. The reason being that until a greater number of businesses begin to accept SmartCash as a means of payment, people won&rsquo;t start using their SmartCash and SmartCash owners will always see it as an investment. Several lessons and observations have been made from our first project and there is the need to factor in merchants and business adoption to our mass educational campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>MILESTONES</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MAY 2018:</strong>&nbsp;The first region to start with is Eastern Region, this region offers the best opportunity for foreign nationals and Ghanaians to adopt SMARTCASH as minerals and natural resources like Gold, Bauxite and Diamond are highly concentrated here for trade.

He recently did a great video about Smartcash. After watching his video, I&rsquo;m now in the process of setting up a Smartcash node.&nbsp;Anyway, I think it would be great to support his project to help refugees by teaching them how to use crypto and giving some away for free to help kick start the economy. DigiByte&nbsp;has already made a contribution to his effort and David is vocal about the support he has received. It would be good public relations for Smartcash to also be involved.</p>\n<p>He has asked for&nbsp;$1950 to buy 30 more laptops. I know he has received some donations towards this already, but I&rsquo;d like to propose just giving David some Smartcash to use in anyway towards his worthwhile project.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>I read his post and recommend to make a proposal for it, it ended up being me making it.</p>\n<p>I think this is a really good way for smartcash to help and show what it can do, and possibly we can get just like DigiBite some coverage from David Hay.</p>\n<p>for $1950 we could give 30 laptops to a school maybe it even means changing the education in a whole school. and get the attention that come's with it. I think this is a great oppurtunity to being able to help this community directly. maybe David Hay will even fall in love with the amazing user exspierience I have exspierienced with the SmartCash mobile and web wallet.</p>",

Additionally, flyers will be used to invite the student community and the public in general.</p>\n<p>Why did you choose those speakers?<br />For their great contribution in the promotion of cryptocurrencies in the region and their specialization in next subjects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Saul Qui&ntilde;ones is one of the most important financial analysts in Canc&uacute;n talking about cryptocurrencies, involved in issues of the Fintech Law. (radio and print interviews).</li>\n<li>George Crewe is a pioneer in the promotion of Blockchain technology in Cancun.</li>\n<li>Omar Ucan, SmartCash Ambassador in Mexico, initiator of the Smart Fridays and the Talent Land 2018 proposal.</li>\n<li>Abelardo Dzib is an engineer in systems and information technologies, specializing in Smart Nodes configuration and technical support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong><br />With this proposal we will have a positive impact on the SmartCash community. Focused on the students, since, education in Mexico does not include this type of topics. First, it is important to inform about technology and what it represents in the future. And, second, that university students in different fields are given the opportunity to demonstrate their skills, their versatility and, in the short term, the improvement of work teams for proposals and ideas in the community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

By building our product around Smart from the very beginning, we will position Smart to quickly grow its user base as our company’s user base increases.  A win-win outcome for all.  \n\nIn addition to increasing the number of Smart users, we believe our platform will provide value to the Smart community in the following ways: \n•\tEasy and Hassle Free SmartNode Deployment\n•\tIncreased Institutional Interest in Smart\n•\tIncreased Long Term Value of Smart\n•\tHelpful Analytical Information for Current SmartNode Owners\n•\tIncreased Security for the Smart Network\n•\tOutsourced SmartNode Support\nAll of these benefits are explained in greater detail below.

our pre-alpha product and (2) an alpha launch. We will offer both the soft launch and alpha launch exclusively to the Smart community. The pre-alpha product will allow a user to launch and host SmartNodes on our platform. Subject to legal and regulatory review, the alpha product will add additional features including the ability to pool Smart tokens with other users to launch and host a SmartNode, the option to automatically transfer payouts into additional SmartNodes and access to our portfolio of tools to analyze the performance of their masternodes.</p>\n<p>The funding from the Smartcash community will be used to invest in four key areas: (1) security (2) reliability (3) regulatory and (4) customer experience. Our investment in security means that we will adhere to the best practices of web application security (&ldquo;OWASP&rdquo;), user authentication, data encryption, backup, and disaster recovery. Our investment in reliability means that there will be no downtime for your masternodes because our state of the art distributed cluster architecture will allow for virtually zero service disruption. Our investment in regulatory means that we will differentiate ourselves from competitors by maintaining compliance with all pertinent regulations and laws. MetaNode intends to comply with applicable state money transmission laws, federal Money Services Business registration, KYC and AML statutes, and any relevant foreign licensure requirements. Our investment in customer experience means that we will design the site to be intuitive so that it becomes the number one consumer facing masternode hosting site.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we believe that our team&rsquo;s focus and deep expertise in security, engineering, legal and product issues will help us drive user growth both in the Smart community and the masternode community as whole. Right now MetaNode has the team, timeline and vision in place in order to build this platform. Funding is the missing piece of the puzzle to build this exciting platform and it is the reason why we are before the Smart community now.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Benefits for Smartcash Community</u></strong></p>\n<p>We believe that an early partnership between MetaNode and Smart would provide a number of benefits for the Smart community, including:</p>\n<p><strong>Easy SmartNode Deployment:</strong> Running a masternode involves technical knowledge that the average token holder, let alone crypto newbie, does not possess. By completely automating the process, MetaNode will make masternode deployment as easy a single click. Think Amazon&rsquo;s &ldquo;1-Click Ordering&rdquo;, but for masternodes instead of USB cables.</p>\n<p><strong>Increase Smart User Base:</strong> MetaNode will become the on-ramp for crypto users looking to quickly and easily create masternodes. By building our company around Smart from the very beginning, we will position Smart to quickly grow its user base as our company&rsquo;s user base increases. Economists call this a WIN-WIN (technically they call it an integrative negotiated agreement, but let&rsquo;s not get bogged down in the details).</p>\n<p><strong>Increase Long Term Value of Smart:</strong> We intend for MetaNode to become the gold standard for masternode creation and management service providers. As we attract more users to our platform, we believe this increased interest will most likely result in a long term increase in the value of Smart.</p>\n<p><strong>Increase Information for Current SmartNode Owners:</strong> MetaNode will allow users access to a portfolio of analytical tools that will allow them to better analyze their masternodes, as well as make informed financial decisions. Less HODL and more STAEK.</p>\n<p><strong>Help Secure the Smart Network:</strong> SmartNodes play a vital role in protecting the integrity and efficiency of the network. By automating the setup process, MetaNode will help to further increase decentralization. This in turn will help secure the Smart network from malicious attacks and stagnation. Similar to how the Black Panther&rsquo;s Dora Milaje protect Wakanda from avaricious outsiders looking for its vibranium&hellip;and now back to the proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Outsource SmartNode Support</strong>: MetaNode understands that Smart developers spend a significant amount of their time on Discord helping new users launch and maintain SmartNodes. By providing 24/7 support to SmartNode owners, we will relieve the burden on Smart developers and let them do what they do best: SHIP EPIC CODE!</p>\n<p><strong><u>Timeline, Deliverables and Funding </u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 9 weeks</p>\n<p><strong>Deliverable One: </strong>Soft Launch of MetaNode Platform</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 4 weeks</li>\n<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Pre-alpha product rolled out to a small group of Smart community users.</li>\n<li><strong>Features:</strong> Users will be able to:\n<ol>\n<li>Launch and host individual SmartNodes.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Deliverable Two: </strong>Alpha Launch of MetaNode Platform</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Timeline: </strong>5 weeks</li>\n<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Alpha product rolled out exclusively to the entire Smart community.</li>\n<li><strong>Features:</strong> Users will be able to:\n<ol>\n<li>Launch and host individual SmartNodes.</li>\n<li>Pool Smart with other users to launch and host a SmartNode.</li>\n<li>Automatically transfer payouts into additional SmartNodes.</li>\n<li>Utilize our portfolio of tools to analyze the performance of their masternodes.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Funding</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engineering Costs: $22,275</li>\n<li>Legal Costs: $13,500</li>\n<li>Operational Costs: $910.38</li>\n<li>Total Cost: $36,685.38</li>\n</ul>\n<table width=\"472\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"72\">\n<p>Amount ($)</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"90\">\n<p>Amount (Smart)</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"310\">\n<p>Description</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"72\">\n<p>$22,275</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"90\">\n<p>TBD</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"310\">\n<p>Full stack developer working 45 hours a week at $55/hour for 9 weeks.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"72\">\n<p>$13,500</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"90\">\n<p>TBD</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"310\">\n<p>Attorneys at Ourboros LLP researching and providing legal advice at $650/hour for 20 hours.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"72\">\n<p>$584</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"90\">\n<p>TBD</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"310\">\n<p>Testing 40 virtual machines for 730 hours at $.02/hour.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"72\">\n<p>$219.4</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"90\">\n<p>TBD</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"310\">\n<p>LastPass subscription</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"72\">\n<p>$52.98</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"90\">\n<p>TBD</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"310\">\n<p>Metanode.io domain purchase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"72\">\n<p>$38.11</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"90\">\n<p>TBD</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"310\">\n<p>G Suite</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"72\">\n<p>$15.89</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"90\">\n<p>TBD</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"310\">\n<p>Adobe Acrobat Pro DC Subscription</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>What is the MetaNode platform?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaNode is a secure and reliable masternode hosting site that allow users to launch individual masternodes or pool tokens with other users to access masternode dividends.</p>\n<p><strong>What coins will MetaNode host?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaNode is committed to working with the Smart community to increase Smart&rsquo;s user base, adoption and long term value. In order to reach that goal, we think it is vital to create a dynamic platform that offers different options to match our user&rsquo;s interests and demands. A decision to host other coins will only happen after a number of steps have been taken.</p>\n<p><strong>How will pooling work?</strong></p>\n<p>Pooling will work automatically. Instead of having to scroll through dozens of masternodes, users will deposit their tokens into a contribution pool. Once the staking requirement has been met, the user is notified that he/she is a fractional owner of a masternode. Their masternode network fee share will be proportional to their contribution. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a minimum amount needed for pooling?</strong></p>\n<p>No. Unlike other services, pooling will not be limited to a minimum amount. If you have only 1 Smart token our system will still accept it.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I host an individual masternode?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Our platform allows you to host an individual SmartNode too.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it a difference process for running an individual masternode vs. a pooled masternode?</strong></p>\n<p>No. Our intuitive interface makes it so that you can deposit any SMART amount and our system will automatically generate as many SmartNodes as possible. Any remainder Smart tokens will be directed to a contribution wallet that will launch a SmartNode as soon as the wallet contains enough Smartcash.</p>\n<p><strong>How much does the service cost?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaNode will keep a small transaction fee from the distribution of Smartnode rewards in order to maintain our service. We are still working on finalizing the fee amount, but it will be competitive with other services.</p>\n<p><strong>Where are the masternodes hosted?</strong></p>\n<p>Masternodes will be hosted in data centers located in multiple regions across the globe by a leading cloud service provider. Hosting masternodes in multiple regions ensures redundancy if a single region goes offline. This strategy has the added benefit of preventing centralization of masternodes in a single region.</p>\n<p><strong>How will MetaNode track masternodes?</strong></p>\n<p>Our state of the art telemetry and diagnostic solution will be monitoring each deployed masternode as well as the whole platform. This solution will track performance, availability, security events and usage. In the event of an anomaly or a potential system failure, the MetaNode self-healing system will trigger an alert and deploy the fix. Our team of highly skilled Site Reliability Engineers will be involved in any issues that directly affect the users or masternode rewards. As advocates for transparency, the MetaNode team will be sharing masternode telemetry data with our users.</p>\n<p><strong>How will MetaNode mitigate service disruptions?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaNode&rsquo;s state of the art distributed cluster architecture will allow for virtually zero service disruption. Due to the containerization of our masternodes, we can rapidly redeploy nodes as needed. If an extended downtime is detected or expected, we will have the ability to quickly re-establish masternodes on other servers/regions, assuming the outage is centralized to clusters or regions and not 100% of the cloud provider&rsquo;s services. Users will be able to track the health status of their masternode through an intuitive telemetry dashboard. Additionally, users will be able to set up notifications to alert them of rewards or other events.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Team</u></strong></p>\n<p>Joseph Connor: CEO</p>\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-connor-b6a96a16/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-connor-b6a96a16/</a></p>\n<p>Nick Streit: COO</p>\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-streit-72123797/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-streit-72123797/</a></p>\n<p>David Selinger: CIO/Lead Dev</p>\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-selinger-06789336/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-selinger-06789336/</a></p>\n<p>Dmitrii Fotesco: CTO</p>\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrii-fotesco-aa43b94b/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrii-fotesco-aa43b94b/</a></p>\n<p><strong><u>Experience</u></strong></p>\n<p>Our team has diverse experience as crypto miners, traders, investors and masternode owners.

            "description": "<p>June 19th is going to be an exciting day for Crypto in South Africa. I had a chance to propose to StartUp Grind's director in Johannesburg to make June's event about Cryptocurrency. She welcomed the idea since Crypto is currently a big topic in South Africa and they haven't done an event of this type before. They also gave me the responsibility to choose the main speaker as well as a four man panel for the day. Within my network, I managed to pull out a great panel of notable people in the space. Some of them, which I've had on my podcast before.</p>\n<p><strong>Who are the speakers at the event?</strong></p>\n<p>Here is a list of people I have managed to get to speak at the event:</p>\n<p>1) Roger Ver&nbsp;(Introduction) - He wont be able to make it in person but he will do a skype talk live.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) Dan van de ghinste (Main speaker) - Co-founder of Blockstarters(The first and only Blockchain incubator in South Africa)&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.blockstarters.com/\">http://www.blockstarters.com/</a></p>\n<p>3) Shakes Motshilili&nbsp;(Panel)- Founder of Aziza Coin (The first SARS(Tax man) endorsed crypto in South Africa), Co-Founder of Africa New Energies)</p>\n<p>4) Tawanda Kembo&nbsp;(Panel) - Founder of Golix (The only Crypto exchange in Zimbabwe)</p>\n<p>5) Mpho Dagada (Panel) - Crypto investor and educator. Also Author of Mr Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>5) Grey Jabesi, myself as host of the panel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The agenda \"Beyond Bitcoin\" is meant to introduce the audience to the whole world of cryptocurrency. When most people read or hear the word \"Cryptocurrency\", they usually think of the concept of Bitcoin. So we want to discuss other applications of Blockchain technology and how Africa can take advantage of this new technology.</p>\n<p>The event will be recorded on both video and audio.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Smartcash should get Involved?<br /></strong>I love and support smartcash and this event is covering other use cases of cryoticurrency and smartcash is a good example. I think this event will be a great place for good exposure as well. I will have sometime to speak and I will host the panel so I will talk about Smartcash. Imagine me in a Smartcash tshirt on stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Bulding<br /></strong>Myself and my team are based in Cape Town but since we'll be in Johannesburg for 5 days. We'll do the following community bulding activities:</p>\n<p>- After event dinner with the speakers etc (Invite only)<br />- I will work with one of the Alexandra radio host to do alive smartcash competetion on radio<br />- SmartCash beers on Friday the 22 of June<br />- Cape Town Bitcoin Banter group meetup on Sunday the 24th of June<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Blockstarters Smartnode<br /></strong>Blockstarters is the first and only blockchain inclubator in South africa. They have open space for blockchain startups to work in as well as educational facilities including a mining farm.

The roadshow has been successful in the two regions with participants mainly worried about how to get smartcash and where to spend it and this has necessitated incorporating businesses and merchant adoption into the roadshow activities. The roadshow will continue from the southern part of Ghana which is also the business hub starting from Eastern region, Western region, Volta region and Central region. Each region will see a conference, two radio discussion and a TV discussion with a minimum of 100 participants comprising of business owners, agencies and the general public",
            "description": "<p>Hello smarties! My name Mohammed Awal Sani known as Cryptowall on the smartcash discord page, from Ghana West Africa. I am submitting this proposal as my smartcash roadshow extension and to embark on extra activities on businesses and merchant adoption. The second phase of the smartcash roadshow in Ghana has been successfully covered another three regions, greater Accra, Ashanti and Brong Ahafo region of Ghana making it a total of six regions effectively covered so far in six regions and more than 1000s wallets have been created. Updates on the previous works can be found on YouTube @cryptowall55, twitter @cryptowall55 and Facebook @smartcashgh. Through the second phase of the project, 0ver 1000s of individuals and some businesses got to know about smartacsh and its amazing features such as the smart rewards and the speed of transactions. The most important part is the outreach to as many people and businesses through our meetups and the mass communication media to create awareness and education for future adoption and acceptance. It&rsquo;s worth noting that every new revolution takes time before massive adoption and mainstreaming due to some level of risk. I am however confident that smartcash have a positive growth potentials considering its age and its popularity. Smartcash will be the dominant cryptocurrency for the exchange of goods and services in the near future considering the various efforts by various teams sponsored by smartcash all over the globe.</p>\n<p>Gradually cryptocurrency adoption in Africa is taking roots at an admirable pace. However, one critical area that needs a big push is merchants and business acceptance as a form of payment for goods and services. It is very indispensable since that will boost adoption and offer Africans the freedom and convenience virtual currencies brings and to bridge the currency limitation of international trade. None the less, getting smartcash to the masses is still very paramount that need more of outreach. Also it is crucial to get more fiat/smartcash exchanges that can provide liquidity to smartcash holders. Businesses will be motivated to accept smartcash if there is a large user base and the only way to expand user base is through aggressive outreach.</p>\n<p>Ghana is one of the four countries where cryptocurrency adoption is picking up remarkably in Africa. The West African Nation is home to over 25.9 million people and counted among entities where monetary mismanagement has ruined lives and wealth creation. There is no doubt the country is ripe for use of cryptocurrencies</p>\n<p>The third phase of the roadshow will be geared towards covering the remaining four regions of Ghana. The roadshow will take different dimension in this round, holding regional conference in each of the four regions with at least 100participants comprising of business owners and potential investors, two radio discussions to reach over 50000 listerners and a Television discussion to reach over 1million people. This will see business and merchants approach, to get merchants and businesses to accept smartcash and make it an alternative medium of exchange to the Ghanaian cedi and also expand the user base in Ghana. The conference will also see government agencies to discuss how to enhance the public sector with the blockchain technology and the relevance of cryptocurrency in our lives and the Ghanaian economy using smartcash as a case study. The radio and TV discussions will feature call inn sessions for questions and answers and Smartcash tokens given to listeners who call to ask questions and or contribute. The radio discussions will be heard by over 200,000 people every week and over 1000,000 viewers to the TV discussions. At least 10s of business owners will take part in the conference in each region to learn how to internationalise their businesses using smartcash as medium of exchange. The success of the roadshow and other projects carried out by various teams in Ghana has made smartcash popular in Ghana than any cryptocurrency. The extension of this project will further make smartcash popular in the remaining four regions. The project will continue to pursue the mobile money/mpesa agenda in the rest of the regions to be covered by outreach even though the acceptance is not much. I anticipate a positive results soon.</p>\n<p>This phase of the project will start from June and end in september. This will start from Eastern Region, Western, Central Region and Volter Region with massive outreach to potential investors and businesses in each region. The likes of smartrewards and smartnode will be used to make smartcash appealing to investors</p>\n<p>This project will contribute significantly in pushing smartcash to be the best digital currency in terms of adoption and usage and a perfect alternative to the fiat currency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ACTION PLAN:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A conference will be organised in each region comprising of business owners, mobile money operators, potential investors and government agencies.</li>\n<li>Businesses that have willingly accepted to incorporate smartcash in to their businesses will be giving additional extensive training on smartcash and how to use the wallet for sending and receiving payment</li>\n<li>Recruiting ambassadors and training them to attend to businesses in each region</li>\n<li>Getting smartcash listed on other fiat-crypto exchanges in Ghana.eg payplux.com and others</li>\n</ol>\n<p>OUR ACHIEVEMENTS</p>\n<p>The team have done successfully organised 12 meetups, 12 radio interview, and six TV discussion creating more than 2000 wallets for the past six months.

But many of them don&rsquo;t really understand the power of Smartcash, they just don&rsquo;t understand how to buy and sell Smartcash and I&rsquo;ve noticed they think it&rsquo;s too complicated.</p>\n<p>They are completely newbies and they feel overflooded with too much information.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that for people like you and me, it&rsquo;s very easy to understand the terminology and we perfectly understand the new concepts.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s very hard to explain from the very beginning to people that has zero knowledge.</p>\n<p>They just don&rsquo;t believe in the concepts, they don&rsquo;t believe in Rewards, Airdrops, the Hive, they think I&rsquo;m in dirty business.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not the technology complexity, it&rsquo;s that they are used to fiat money and the rules of the old world.</p>\n<p>So I&rsquo;m writing this pre-proposal because I know it will have a deep impact to introduce people to Smartcash.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m doing this through a proposal to show the power of the Hive and the Smartcash community.</p>\n<p>So this is my proposal:</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The Absolute Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Smartcash will cover the following topics, every topic will become into a video.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll make one video per week.

The time invested in these activities are not in the budget because I want to volunteer some of the activities related to the promotion of the Guide.</p>\n<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>\n<p>So, I love technology and its impact in the society. I&rsquo;m currently 22 years old and I deeply fell in love with the blockchain technology. I see many futuristic scenarios about how the blockchain will transform our world and our society. And you know what? Last year when I knew Smartcash I knew true love. I know that Smartcash has the potential to change the world entirely. The Smarthive concept is a piece of smart art. And I&rsquo;m really engaged with the roadmap.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to introduce to family and friends Smartcash, but I&rsquo;ve been struggling because a lack of a Guide that covers all the topics.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d love to work in order to spread the voice about cryptocurrencies and Smartcash.

            "description": "<div class=\"cooked\">\n<p>Hi smartcash community, my name is <strong>Gawsu Hassan</strong> known on the smartcash community as @<strong>HassanC.</strong> A crypto advocate who believe in the future of SmartCash. For the past six months, I have supported cryptotravelers in advocating cryptocurrency through meet ups and conferences. I am presenting my first proposal which seeks to train and bring on board crypto traders to massively adopt and trade smartcash cryptocurrency on their various local coinexchange websites in Ghana, to allow business the freedom to adopt and trade in SmartCash as well as incorporate it in their businesses. Ghana is a middle income country with a relatively large population of over 27 million people. The three Northern regions where we intend to Carry out the program are characterized mostly by agricultural activities. A number of SmartCash programs have taken place in Ghana targeting the youth and businesses and it has really built a great SmartCash community in Ghana but nonetheless, more work still need to be done because few local coinexchanges trade smartcash in Ghana and With the kind of SmartCash community we are building in Ghana, there is the need for coinexchanges to come on board to trade and operate Smartcash cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, there numerous exchange markets trade in bitcoin, etheurum and litecoin. Some of the local exchange markets include:<br />&bull; <a href=\"http://www.ebitcoinics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.ebitcoinics.com<span class=\"badge badge-notification clicks\" title=\"1 click\">1</span></a><br />&bull; <a href=\"http://www.zenithcoins.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.zenithcoins.com</a><br />&bull; <a href=\"http://www.spectrocoin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.spectrocoin.com</a><br />&bull; <a href=\"http://www.localbitcoin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.localbitcoin.com</a><br />&bull; <a href=\"http://www.ecurrency4u.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.ecurrency4u.net</a><br />&bull; <a href=\"http://www.payplux.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.payplux.com</a><br />&bull; <a href=\"http://www.cbtekghana.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.Cbtekghana.com</a>&nbsp;etc.<br />The workshop will be held in the three Northern regions to educate the exchange markets as well as businesses to adopt and trade in SmartCash. About 10 coin exchanges will be invited of which two participants are expected to represent each exchange market targeting at camping 20 participants for a week intensive training and adoption of smartcash on their exchange markets across the three regions.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAN</strong><br />All invited local coin exchange markets will be given an intensive training on Blockchain Technology, Cryptocurrency and Smartcash cryptocurrency and the need for them to massively adopt and start trading Smartcash crypto currency on their coinexchange markets. They will also be trained on how they can advertise Smartcash cryptocurrency on their local coinexchange markets website. The workshop will also train participants all the unique features of smartcash (smarthive, smartrewards, smartnodes, instant send, smartcard, etc.) and also spell out the smartcash roadmap to participants. Five local exchange markets that seem active and interested in trading smartcash on their markets will be given a token of smartcash to start trading and operation of smartcash on their local coinexchanges.</p>\n<p><strong>PLANNED ACTIVITIES</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The workshop will train all invited coin exchange markets on<br />&bull; Blockchain Technology and SmartCash in specific<br />&bull; How to download and setup SmartCash wallets<br />&bull; Key features of SmartCash,<br />&bull; How they can expand their local markets internationally,<br />&bull; The advantages of trading SmartCash on their local markets,<br />&bull; And the need for participants to use SmartRewards and SmartNodes as a store of value in the long term to realize their entrepreneurial goals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Participants will also be trained on how they can partner with businesses to trade with SmartCash especially those into import and export of goods and services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Local exchange markets that seem interested will be given some token of SmartCash to advertise and trade SmartCash on their markets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, we will also set up the first SmartCash exchange center in Ghana. This office will serve as a point of physical contact for people to walk in and learn more about SmartCash. Also, this center will serve as a place for SmartCash exchange throughout the country and we intend to establish SmartCash Centers in every region of Ghana in the future. This will help coordinate all activities of SmartCash in the country, promote SmartCash through trained Ambassadors and as well as help reduce doubts about Cryptocurrencies and SmartCash in particular. This body will also hedge against the price of SmartCash by allowing businesses that accepts SmartCash to record all transactions in Ghanaian cedi equivalent. This will reduce the risks associated with businesses accepting SmartCash as payment for goods and services in case there is a fall in price. We shall also undertake the following activities:<br />&bull; Monthly SmartCash Business meets ups<br />&bull; One on one intensive interaction with business owners for massive adoption.<br />&bull; Training of SmartCash Business Ambassadors to reach out to as many businesses as possible<br />&bull; Running of SmartCash promotion and Business Advertisements over television and Radio stations in Ghana.<br />All these will help create new opportunities for effective marketing, networking and development of fruitful partnerships within the business sector.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong><br /><strong>Week 1</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Three (3) days intensive lecture on blockchain technology and SmartCash cryptocurrency</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three (3) days intensive practical&rsquo;s on how to download and migrate smartcash wallets to their local exchange markets websites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dinner and departure of all invited participants</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Week 2 &amp; 3</strong><br />A.

            "description": "<p># &iquest;Why online Marketplace?</p>\n<p>Global internet commerce has grown exponentially in recent years, In M&eacute;xico Generation X, Millennials and Baby Boomers now have more access to the Internet. Free Public Networks and Smartphones stimulate growth of users and maintain connectivity 24 hours a day.</p>\n<p>In 2016, 65.5 million of Mexicans used internet, today more than 71 million users are calculated. Three out of every four Mexican Internet users buy online with consumption averages close to 370 dollars per month. The Generation X and The Millenias are the most active in terms of Internet purchases, possibly due to their greater economic capacity.</p>\n<p>With a powerful and creative marketing campaign aimed to Generation X (1966-1982) and the Millenias (1988-2002) we will generate new Smartcash investors who will have the incentive to make immediate commercial transactions in our platform and they will put new products to sell. The Community of SMARTCASH users in Mexico will grow significantly and we will be able to do more and more real commercial transactions with the SmartCash Wallets.</p>\n<p>This is a Project in which worth Invest.</p>\n<p>Now it's time to give a chance to cripto marketplace, the first one in M&eacute;xico.</p>\n<p># Strategy</p>\n<p>### Growth SmartCash Community</p>\n<p>I will Develop an e-commerce marketplace where the Smart community can exchange their smartcash for trending products previously reviewed by recognized youtubers*, that will make the buyers sure about the product they are going to acquire*.</p>\n<p>* This is thought to be done in phase two. In the phase one we are going to make the video reviews</p>\n<p>* We are going reach our target creating youtube reviews like: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tkwn2MwCRo](http://bit.ly/2srdgBX) and online marketing campaigns</p>\n<p>We want to promote the** growth of the Smart community**, so we devised a way for people to use their smartcash to carry out transactions through an e-commerce platform.</p>\n<p>This marketplace, unlike others (Amazon, Ebay, etc...), will be based on video reviews of the items for sale to reach our audience. The video reviews is one of the most effective sales techniques in e-commerce, even we can achieve thousands of smartcash possible users. The products reviews will be done in a professional way, either by our team or, with help of the most experienced youtubers in the field, thus achieving a greater uptake of new users and an **accelerated growth of the Smart community**. The community can also sell their own products in the plattform. With this medium-term strategy we can grow the community greatly.</p>\n<p>![image alt text](image_0.png)</p>\n<p>Also, in order to quickly **grow the community** and have a quick capture of new users, we will carry out a spectacular draw (raffle) of two flagship smartphones, being one of the requirements to enter the draw to open a Wallet with a minimum amount of Smartcash. With that we have contemplated the opening of at least 300 wallets in the first month.</p>\n<p>In the second month under the same strategy we hope to open 1000 more wallets and have transacted with real wallets about up to 3000 dollars.</p>\n<p>### Engage community</p>\n<p>In addition, another strong stimulant for people to use their cryptocurrency is that all announced products will have a **significant discount when purchased with Smartcash**. The strategy to follow for offering products with big discounts will be the following.</p>\n<p>Smartcash will offer an impressive 50% discount for new users who use their smartwallet.</p>\n<p>The contribution of smartcash for the 50% discount will bring a great growth of new users who really transact with their smartwallets.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there will be **six ****meetups**** to provide information about the cryptoeconomy and smartcash**, as well as seek for smartcash investors and investors to advertise products within our platform.</p>\n<p>### Topics:</p>\n<p>1. What Blockchain and Smartcash is and how it works,</p>\n<p>2. Advantages of Smartcash over other cryptocurrencies,</p>\n<p>3. How to open my Smartwallet,</p>\n<p>4. How to invest Smartcash</p>\n<p>5. How to make transactions with Smartcash.</p>\n<p>6. The future of smarthcash,</p>\n<p>7. How to sell your products in our smartcash plattform.</p>\n<p>Also, we are going to create **Youtube content** explaining all of this issues for the spanish speaker community in the world, so they can see it and get interested in becoming part of the Smartcash community.</p>\n<p>By creating a **reliable marketplace platform**, in which the buyers will have the security that they are going to acquire the product they are seeing (on the reviews) and which also accepts Smartcash as payment, we will motivate people to adopt this cryptocurrency and with that the smart community will grow even more.</p>\n<p>### Referral program</p>\n<p>To generate an exponential growth of new users we will reward the members for each referral that is registered with a new smart wallet, a personalized link will be generated to send to all their contacts and they will obtain 1 additional ticket for the draw for each successful referral.</p>\n<p># Six week plan</p>\n<p>### WEEK 1:</p>\n<p>Start back-end development $750 (Hosting, domain, development).</p>\n<p>Premiere Pro license $239 (For video Editing).</p>\n<p>SmartCash Branding Products $2000 (For 50% discount)</p>\n<p>Staff 1 $135 (Video editor 2 videos p/week)</p>\n<p>Staff 2 $135 (Staff 2 will help to follow up the meetups, making after sales tasks, payments, admin tasks etc... )</p>\n<p>1 meetups $100 catering (for participants)</p>\n<p>T-shirts, Hats and souvenirs, flyers $250 (for participants)</p>\n<p>Giveaway $200 (smart cash for 30 participants $6 dollar each)</p>\n<p>Legal, acounting and admin advisory $270</p>\n<p>### WEEK 2:</p>\n<p>Start development landingpage $750 (smart phone contest and I will finish front end of marketplace).</p>\n<p>Online Marketing $300 (Facebok ads, youtube ads).</p>\n<p>Staff 1 $135 (Video editor 2 videos p/week)</p>\n<p>Staff 2 $135 (Staff 2 will help to follow up the meetups, making after sales task, payments, admin tasks etc... )</p>\n<p>Branding Products Shipping Costs $475</p>\n<p>Draw one smartphone $850 for build community</p>\n<p>suppliers, catering, smart souvenirs, follow up on those registered, and more)</p>\n<p>1 meetups $100 catering (for participants)</p>\n<p>T-shirts, Hats and souvenirs, flyers $250 (for participants)</p>\n<p>Giveaway $200 (smart cash for 30 participants $6 dollar each)</p>\n<p>Legal, acounting and admin advisory $270</p>\n<p>### WEEK 3:</p>\n<p>Launch marketplace v1.0 $750 (Launch v1.0, maintenance and dev new features).</p>\n<p>Online Marketing $300 (Facebok ads, youtube ads).</p>\n<p>Staff 1 $135 (Premiere pro editor 2 videos p/week)</p>\n<p>Staff 2 $135 Staff 2 will help to follow up the meetups, making after sales task, payments, admin tasks etc... )</p>\n<p>Branding Products Shipping Costs $475</p>\n<p>SmartCash Branding Products $2000 (for 50% discount)</p>\n<p>1 meetups $100 catering (for participants)</p>\n<p>T-shirts, Hats and souvenirs, flyers $250 (for participants)</p>\n<p>Giveaway $200 (smart cash for 30 participants $6 dollar each)</p>\n<p>Legal, acounting and admin advisory $270</p>\n<p>### WEEK 4:</p>\n<p>Maintenance and new features $750 (maintenance and new features. development).</p>\n<p>Online Marketing $300 (Facebook ads, youtube ads).</p>\n<p>Staff 1 $135 (Premiere pro editor 2 videos p/week)</p>\n<p>Staff 2 $135 (Staff 2 will help to follow up the meetups, making after sales task, payments, admin tasks etc... )</p>\n<p>Branding Products Shipping Costs $475</p>\n<p>1 meetups $100 catering (for participants)</p>\n<p>T-shirts, Hats and souvenirs, flyers $250 (for participants)</p>\n<p>Giveaway $200 (smart cash for 30 participants $6 dollar each)</p>\n<p>Legal, acounting and admin advisory $270</p>\n<p>### WEEK 5:</p>\n<p>Online Marketing $300 (Facebook ads, youtube ads).</p>\n<p>Staff 1 $135 (Premiere pro editor 2 videos p/week)</p>\n<p>Staff 2 $135 (Staff 2 will help to follow up the meetups)</p>\n<p>Branding Products Shipping Costs $475</p>\n<p>1 meetups $100 catering (for participants)</p>\n<p>T-shirts, Hats and souvenirs, flyers $250 (for participants)</p>\n<p>Giveaway $200 (smart cash for 30 participants $6 dollar each)</p>\n<p>Legal, acounting and admin advisory $270</p>\n<p>### WEEK 6:</p>\n<p>Staff 1 $135 (Premiere pro editor 2 videos p/week)</p>\n<p>Staff 2 $135 (Staff 2 will help to follow up the meetups)</p>\n<p>1 meetups $100 catering (for participants)</p>\n<p>T-shirts, Hats and souvenirs, flyers $250 (for participants)</p>\n<p>Giveaway $200 (smart cash for 30 participants $6 dollar each)</p>\n<p>Legal, acounting and admin advisory $270</p>\n<p>Detail week by week plan and budget:</p>\n<p>[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o3OY1htkA6JA_aTn0izBe0VKi0TNX0_rYeNnakUwxhw/edit?usp=sharing](http://bit.ly/2LMrfv8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I have been working closely with @shitu on his project &ldquo;Introducing SmartCash to 5 Ghanaian Universities and I have also been working around the clock with @cryptosoja on his project &ldquo;SmartCash for Senior High Schools&rdquo;. I am submitting my first proposal &ldquo;<strong>SMARTCASH AND BLOCKCHAIN ADOPTION CAMPAIGN AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP SUMMIT IN GHANA&rdquo; </strong>which seeks to empower young Ghanaian entrepreneurs to adopt and use SmartCash in order to realize and achieve their entrepreneurial goals and to also attain financial freedom.</p>\n<p>Ghana has a youthful population.

The youth therefore constitute the vital force for national development. Entrepreneurship helps to alleviate the problem of unemployment, to overcome the issue of stagnation and to increase the competiveness and growth of businesses and industries. For this reason, most of the youth are in to entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>However, entreprenuers faces numerous challenges such as high cost of transaction fee with banking system, difficulty with online shopping due to currency appreciation and depreciation as well as luck of funding for future plans. This present the best opportunity to introduce SmartCash to young entrepreneurs to massively adopt and use it for their daily transactions, for purchase/sales of goods and services online as also serve as an investment avenue for funding future entrepreneurial business plans.

Therefore the proposal intends to continue smartcash to secondary schools in Ghana and make a target of 30 secondary schools within a period of 2 months with the development of interest and the acceptance of smartcash by secondary schools, since we need schools to understand the relevance of cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and smartcash as a means of payment which is easy, fast and can be processed immediately. For the first time this initiative will be introduce into the country, to introduce smart to secondary schools in Ghana will help expand the smartcash frontier and the increment of smartcash usability in Ghana. This project is aimed at introducing Smartcash to students in the secondary level in Ghana. The reason is to educate them on the importance of youth savings as a means of creating access to and a key link between economic opportunities and outcomes for young people and enabling them to manage emergencies, invest in their education as well as improve their future orientation",
            "description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><u>I</u></strong><strong><u>NTRODUCTION</u></strong></p>\n<p>Alhassan Abdul Wadud<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptosoja\">https://twitter.com/cryptosoja</a>is my name known on the smartcash community as cryptosoja. A crypto advocate who believe smartcash is the future of payments. I have supported cryptotravelers in advocating cryptocurrency through meet ups and conferences under the umbrella of our free markets and liberty think tank. Due to the increasing adoption of cryptocurrency in Africa and with the passion and enthusiasm I have for smartcash and as part of my efforts to inflate the adoption and usage of smartcash</p>\n<p>Having successfully completed the phase one of this project in Ghana, covering the northern region of Ghana (Tamale) from late April to late May 2018, I am submitting the second phase of my proposal to cover the next two regions of the country namely: the upper east region and Upper West region.</p>\n<p>Works in phase one</p>\n<p><strong><u>DESCRIPTION</u></strong></p>\n<p>First of all I want to say a big thank you to the good members of this community for having funded and assisted our team in many diverse ways in making the first phase of smart for secondary schools successful we say a big thank you to all in my native language; &ldquo;mpagya&rdquo;. Cryptocurrency adoption in Africa is taking root at an admirable pace. However, one of the relevant areas that need a big push is the educational sector to accept and understand the relevance of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and smartcash. This is very essential since that will boost the adoption and offer Africans the freedom and comfort stations to these currencies and Ghana is one of the African countries where adoption is picking up massively. Though the first phase of this project has been successfully completed, some interesting observation were made during and after the events of the first phase of the project. These observations have better informed me on how best to get Smartto the masses in Ghana through this project.</p>\n<p>We observe most teachers were very interested in knowing more about smartcashand the whole project and the opportunities that comes with holding smartcashafter listening to most of our presentations made to the students and ask the team to come back and have a presentation with the teachers as well. Teachers play a major in the development of every country. But unfortunately in Ghana, teachers are among the least paid. But with this opportunities teachers are willing to take advantage of this because of it speculative nature. The second phase of this project intern to organize workshop to educate and trained teachers to find other source of livelihood and impact this new ideas on their students to use smartto start business after high school whilst promoting it.</p>\n<p>We also observe that students forms the major part of the public and because of the continuous increase of graduate unemployment in the country, giving students the urge to leverage available opportunities against the web of unemployment hence student will take keen interest in the speculative returns in smarttowards accumulating capital to start business after school. This project aimed at introducing smartcashto student in the secondary in Ghana. The reason is to educate them on the importance of youth savings as means of creating access to and a key link between economic opportunities and outcomes for young people and enabling them to manage emergencies, invest in their education as well as improve their future orientation. Therefore the proposal intends to introduce smartcash to 6 senior high schools in the upper east and upper west regions and a make a target of 6 schools within a period of two(2) with the development of interest and acceptance of smartcash by high schools ,since we need schools to understand the relevance of cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and smartcash.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong><u>WHY SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENT</u></strong></p>\n<p>The second cycle institutions are the future of the next generation and therefore needs to be educated on the new evolution and if they understand it very well then the cashless system we are aiming for can be achieve. Also students from senior high schools constitute of people with different culture background and form different palace. So if the student are educated, they can serve as ambassadors in their communities to disseminate the information very fast to their people. Again, students are able to make further research about smart on their own that will help them make decisions on their own in the best interest regarding either speculating for future profits, savings on transactions with smart or understanding smart base projects. Student can easily convince their parents and peers from other schools and communities. When student are on vacations, all friends would be backed home and he share what they have learned and think it would benefit their colleagues.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><u>WHAT WE INTERNT TO DO </u></strong></p>\n<p>My team and I intend to organize a meet up with secondary schools across the two regions, within a period oftwo months to discuss the relevance and uses of the blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and smartcash. The reason being that, until a number of schools start to understand the relevant and importance of smartas the future of money, which will soon replace the fiat currency in the near future as payment for goods and services, that smartcash can now be fully recognize for the purpose of it creation. Also all participants will be trained on the blockchain technology, smartcash, how to download and setup smart wallet, key features of smartcash that makes it unique from any other cryptocurrency in the world, how to purchase smartcashfrom local and international exchanges, and the advantages of using smart for their daily transactions worldwide for the payment goods and services, payment of fees/bills, receiving remittances and many more. Students will therefore be encouraged to use their savings to purchase smart to accumulate capital and wealth using smartcash as store of capital in the long term to realize their entrepreneurial goals. Again we intern to print smart manual guide for beginners in this ecosystem. Workshop for teachers of the selected schools and educate them on smartcash.One on one meeting with principals, headmasters/headmistress and school staffs as well. Last but not the least, radio talk show will be held in each region to create public awareness within the region. Also as part of the project, we aim to Increase the adoption of smart as a means of exchange (transacting businesses) and investment.</p>\n<p><strong>STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM</strong></p>\n<p>My team and I have visited a number of schools and gave lectures on blockchain, cryptocurrency and smartcash prior to this project. The team will like to achieve the follow;</p>\n<p>The aim of this proposal is to set S.M.A.R.T (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely), strategy to attract new adopters (newbie&rsquo;s), introduce smart to schools and to reach out to a maximum number of people and increase the adoption of smart. The program would last for two months and 6 secondary schools would be tackled at the end of the program. This project will see a meet ups with school staffs and students, one on one interaction with school proprietors/principals on the need to understand the relevance of blockchain and cryptocurrency as the future of money.</p>\n<p>You can visits this sites to see more of our works</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1744068279013866&amp;id=100002321324381\">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1744068279013866&amp;id=100002321324381</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1739065586180802&amp;id=100002321324381\">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1739065586180802&amp;id=100002321324381</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1738078939612800&amp;id=100002321324381\">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1738078939612800&amp;id=100002321324381</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hZ0Ml7kz2c-kaHz8Xfrh_-2r3AQY6-IL\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hZ0Ml7kz2c-kaHz8Xfrh_-2r3AQY6-IL</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n-7b34oi2E3rQ_W-LG9ucn8IMQWAoEgN\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n-7b34oi2E3rQ_W-LG9ucn8IMQWAoEgN</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9nkDLl42huLnLpHPRzf0WdYwRriQZZU\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9nkDLl42huLnLpHPRzf0WdYwRriQZZU</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9nkDLl42huLnLpHPRzf0WdYwRriQZZU\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9nkDLl42huLnLpHPRzf0WdYwRriQZZU</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/home.php\">https://m.facebook.com/home.php</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9nkDLl42huLnLpHPRzf0WdYwRriQZZU\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9nkDLl42huLnLpHPRzf0WdYwRriQZZU</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KZyV9LePSL8t_2fM6f-4YmYF5f45_Crg\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KZyV9LePSL8t_2fM6f-4YmYF5f45_Crg</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PhQDQM5sgkQYr0giAoSHw64tYzFVRepu\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PhQDQM5sgkQYr0giAoSHw64tYzFVRepu</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TIMELINE:</strong></p>\n<p>The first month will be dedicated to the upper west schools.

            "description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><u>I</u></strong><strong><u>NTRODUCTION</u></strong></p>\n<p>Alhassan Abdul Wadud<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptosoja\">https://twitter.com/cryptosoja</a>is my name known on the smartcash community as cryptosoja. A crypto advocate who believe smartcash is the future of payments. I have supported cryptotravelers in advocating cryptocurrency through meet ups and conferences under the umbrella of our free markets and liberty think tank. Due to the increasing adoption of cryptocurrency in Africa and with the passion and enthusiasm I have for smartcash and as part of my efforts to inflate the adoption and usage of smartcash</p>\n<p>Having successfully completed the phase one of this project in Ghana, covering the northern region of Ghana (Tamale) from late April to late May 2018, I am submitting the second phase of my proposal to cover the next two regions of the country namely: the upper east region and Upper West region.</p>\n<p>Works in phase one</p>\n<p><strong><u>DESCRIPTION</u></strong></p>\n<p>First of all I want to say a big thank you to the good members of this community for having funded and assisted our team in many diverse ways in making the first phase of smart for secondary schools successful we say a big thank you to all in my native language; &ldquo;mpagya&rdquo;. Cryptocurrency adoption in Africa is taking root at an admirable pace. However, one of the relevant areas that need a big push is the educational sector to accept and understand the relevance of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and smartcash. This is very essential since that will boost the adoption and offer Africans the freedom and comfort stations to these currencies and Ghana is one of the African countries where adoption is picking up massively. Though the first phase of this project has been successfully completed, some interesting observation were made during and after the events of the first phase of the project. These observations have better informed me on how best to get Smartto the masses in Ghana through this project.</p>\n<p>We observe most teachers were very interested in knowing more about smartcashand the whole project and the opportunities that comes with holding smartcashafter listening to most of our presentations made to the students and ask the team to come back and have a presentation with the teachers as well. Teachers play a major in the development of every country. But unfortunately in Ghana, teachers are among the least paid. But with this opportunities teachers are willing to take advantage of this because of it speculative nature. The second phase of this project intern to organize workshop to educate and trained teachers to find other source of livelihood and impact this new ideas on their students to use smartto start business after high school whilst promoting it.</p>\n<p>We also observe that students forms the major part of the public and because of the continuous increase of graduate unemployment in the country, giving students the urge to leverage available opportunities against the web of unemployment hence student will take keen interest in the speculative returns in smarttowards accumulating capital to start business after school. This project aimed at introducing smartcashto student in the secondary in Ghana. The reason is to educate them on the importance of youth savings as means of creating access to and a key link between economic opportunities and outcomes for young people and enabling them to manage emergencies, invest in their education as well as improve their future orientation. Therefore the proposal intends to introduce smartcash to 6 senior high schools in the upper east and upper west regions and a make a target of 6 schools within a period of two(2) with the development of interest and acceptance of smartcash by high schools ,since we need schools to understand the relevance of cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and smartcash.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong><u>WHY SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENT</u></strong></p>\n<p>The second cycle institutions are the future of the next generation and therefore needs to be educated on the new evolution and if they understand it very well then the cashless system we are aiming for can be achieve. Also students from senior high schools constitute of people with different culture background and form different palace. So if the student are educated, they can serve as ambassadors in their communities to disseminate the information very fast to their people. Again, students are able to make further research about smart on their own that will help them make decisions on their own in the best interest regarding either speculating for future profits, savings on transactions with smart or understanding smart base projects. Student can easily convince their parents and peers from other schools and communities. When student are on vacations, all friends would be backed home and he share what they have learned and think it would benefit their colleagues.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><u>WHAT WE INTERNT TO DO </u></strong></p>\n<p>My team and I intend to organize a meet up with secondary schools across the two regions, within a period oftwo months to discuss the relevance and uses of the blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and smartcash. The reason being that, until a number of schools start to understand the relevant and importance of smartas the future of money, which will soon replace the fiat currency in the near future as payment for goods and services, that smartcash can now be fully recognize for the purpose of it creation. Also all participants will be trained on the blockchain technology, smartcash, how to download and setup smart wallet, key features of smartcash that makes it unique from any other cryptocurrency in the world, how to purchase smartcashfrom local and international exchanges, and the advantages of using smart for their daily transactions worldwide for the payment goods and services, payment of fees/bills, receiving remittances and many more. Students will therefore be encouraged to use their savings to purchase smart to accumulate capital and wealth using smartcash as store of capital in the long term to realize their entrepreneurial goals. Again we intern to print smart manual guide for beginners in this ecosystem. Workshop for teachers of the selected schools and educate them on smartcash.One on one meeting with principals, headmasters/headmistress and school staffs as well. Last but not the least, radio talk show will be held in each region to create public awareness within the region. Also as part of the project, we aim to Increase the adoption of smart as a means of exchange (transacting businesses) and investment.</p>\n<p><strong>STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM</strong></p>\n<p>My team and I have visited a number of schools and gave lectures on blockchain, cryptocurrency and smartcash prior to this project. The team will like to achieve the follow;</p>\n<p>The aim of this proposal is to set S.M.A.R.T (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely), strategy to attract new adopters (newbie&rsquo;s), introduce smart to schools and to reach out to a maximum number of people and increase the adoption of smart. The program would last for two months and 6 secondary schools would be tackled at the end of the program. This project will see a meet ups with school staffs and students, one on one interaction with school proprietors/principals on the need to understand the relevance of blockchain and cryptocurrency as the future of money.</p>\n<p>You can visits this sites to see more of our works</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1744068279013866&amp;id=100002321324381\">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1744068279013866&amp;id=100002321324381</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1739065586180802&amp;id=100002321324381\">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1739065586180802&amp;id=100002321324381</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1738078939612800&amp;id=100002321324381\">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1738078939612800&amp;id=100002321324381</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hZ0Ml7kz2c-kaHz8Xfrh_-2r3AQY6-IL\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hZ0Ml7kz2c-kaHz8Xfrh_-2r3AQY6-IL</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n-7b34oi2E3rQ_W-LG9ucn8IMQWAoEgN\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n-7b34oi2E3rQ_W-LG9ucn8IMQWAoEgN</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9nkDLl42huLnLpHPRzf0WdYwRriQZZU\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9nkDLl42huLnLpHPRzf0WdYwRriQZZU</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9nkDLl42huLnLpHPRzf0WdYwRriQZZU\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9nkDLl42huLnLpHPRzf0WdYwRriQZZU</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/home.php\">https://m.facebook.com/home.php</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9nkDLl42huLnLpHPRzf0WdYwRriQZZU\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9nkDLl42huLnLpHPRzf0WdYwRriQZZU</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KZyV9LePSL8t_2fM6f-4YmYF5f45_Crg\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KZyV9LePSL8t_2fM6f-4YmYF5f45_Crg</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PhQDQM5sgkQYr0giAoSHw64tYzFVRepu\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PhQDQM5sgkQYr0giAoSHw64tYzFVRepu</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TIMELINE:</strong></p>\n<p>The first month will be dedicated to the upper west schools.

The dormitory facility houses over 700 students, each of these people are potential Brand Ambassadors for SmartCash and can help to further propel SmartCash in the world of Cryptocurrency by exposing the young minds here to SmartCash as their first cryptocurrency. This venue is the perfect environment for introducing SmartCash as it provides a large sample of students coming from different countries and educational backgrounds. Which can help spread the use of SmartCash in a variety of domains and open a channel for SmartCash to establish itself not only in Morocco, but also in numerous other African countries where SmartCash is still unheard of.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The second phase will take place from July 9-13th, under the theme: \"Youth Work: Engaging Young People in Nation Building\". Here, we will have the opportunity to encourage adoption of SmartCash by providing students with a real life example of how to use their SmartCash at various stands that we will put in place. [Traditionally, on the Opening Day, each community prepares a sample of their traditional food to share with the dignitaries and students present. This provides us the opportunity of demonstrating how SmartCash works in a real-life setting. Students will be provided with 50 Smart which they will be able to use to purchase food from any of the Anglophone Union member traditional food stands. Students will also be able to exchange their Smart for dirhams, providing an example of an exchange transaction. Allowing students to witness SmartCash in use in a real-life, face to face and casual environment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Phase two aims to reach a larger number of students as all members of the association will be in attendance as the Cultural Week marks the start of summer holidays and we expect students coming from different towns around Morocco.

With our members coming from all over the African continent, and the rest of the world; we hope to provide Smart Cash with a large platform to raise awareness and introduce Smart Cash to the Moroccan market and also the larger Sub-Saharan market, in particular.</p>\n<p>The Union was established on April 13 2003 by 6 founding student communities: Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone in view of the need to take a closer look at the challenges Anglophone students and trainees may face in Morocco. Reinforcing solidarity and assisting all Anglophone students and trainees residing in Morocco, we aim to facilitate and ensure a better knowledge of our countries, customs and traditions through social, cultural, intellectual and sporting activities.</p>\n<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 event </strong><strong>- <u>BIG 4 Sports Tournament</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Itemized Budget:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><u>NB</u></em></strong>*(Please see the itemized budget Xcel spreadsheet)</p>\n<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Branded Goodies </strong>(T-shirts, caps, drawstring backpacks for packing donations) = $1,840</p>\n<p><strong>Canned Foods and Toiletries for food and toiletry drive </strong>= $2,102.50</p>\n<p><strong>Aggressive Marketing Campaign </strong>(radio, social media, print) = $980.00</p>\n<p><strong>SmartCash Stand </strong>= $300.00 + 5000 SMART</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tent</li>\n<li>5 SmartCash voucher for first 500 attendees = 2500 Smart</li>\n<li>Treasure hunt prizes, hidden wallet prizes, participation rewards to attendees = 2500</li>\n<li>Printer</li>\n<li>Informational Leaflets</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Entertainment</strong> = $360</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Prizes for Big Four Tournament winners</strong> = $475</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Branded Jerseys</li>\n<li>Equipment based on discipline = Footballs (), Volleyballs (), Basketballs</li>\n<li>Medals and Trophies (all teams)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>10% contingency = $605.75</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 Events - </strong><strong><u>Anglophone Week</u></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each year, we hold a Sports and Cultural Week to not only unite students through team sports, but also to share our respective traditions and cultures. This week is usually comprised of: sporting activities (football, volleyball and mini-foot), art (sketches, sculptures, paintings, musical, dance and theatrical expositions) and cultural expositions (food, dance, music and theatre). Our theme this year is inspired theme by The Commonwealth Youth Conference of 2016, held in Pretoria, South Africa.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Theme</strong><strong>: </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;'Youth Work: Engaging Young People in Nation Building'</p>\n<p>Youth workers play a mediatory role between young people and national development by supporting the channelling of youth empowerment to sustained national and global development efforts. Youth Work plays a valuable role in that it creates conditions for enabling and empowering young citizens, and in turn impacts on a country&rsquo;s social, economic, political and environmental success.</p>\n<p>There is a youth bulge across many African Anglophone countries, this demographic dividend can be unleashed and utilised to make significant strides in development, in which youth workers play a crucial role.</p>\n<p>Within this context, the theme also advances the Union's values of gender equity, inclusion, peace, development, human rights and democracy as key tenets that determine meaningful nation-building. The conference will see discussions on the youth worker&rsquo;s role in moving towards these ideals in our respective countries.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Venue :</strong></p>\n<p>Cite Universitaire Internationale</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Speakers : </strong></p>\n<p>President of UASTIM, Ms. Nolwazi S Mkhonta</p>\n<p>Albern Newton - @Cryptonfused</p>\n<p>Terry Lovell - @MoonMan</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Program:</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day One: Opening Ceremony </strong></p>\n<p><em>12:00</em></p>\n<p><u>Opening Remarks: </u></p>\n<p>Opening Remarks by H.E.

For this, we will be providing each community with 500 MAD ($50 equivalent).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>**500 MAD/community</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This will be the first opportunity for students to take up these following roles:</p>\n<p><u>As Vendors</u> &ndash;</p>\n<p>They will present their traditional foods and sell them for SMART using the various payment acceptance methods such as, using printed QR public addresses linked to their co-operations&rsquo; SmartCash wallets which will be embedded into the display tables surfaces, or by interacting directly with buyers and scanning their wallets during transactions. Vendors will also be brand ambassadors for SmartCash and encourage clients to first buy some SMART in order to purchase using that medium as opposed to the fiat which they hold; this will be an educational experience introduced into an otherwise casual buying experience. Students already run small shops out of their rooms, and these can also start accepting payments using SMART.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><u>As Consumers/End Users</u> &ndash;</p>\n<p>Students, after having received their 5 SMART can then go on to buy from the vendors, some food or whatever else may be on sale during the exposition. They will also have the opportunity to purchase additional SMART which will then be an accepted means of payment at any of the booths on campus. Smart Cards, Paper wallets, online wallets and hopefully functional electrum wallets will be introduced to the students who will be sufficiently educated by the many volunteers and vendors circulating the campus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Exchange rate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1x1 |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 SMART = 1 MAD</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart Card printing service provided at the dedicated SmartCash booth.</li>\n<li>Demos will also be provided by volunteers who&rsquo;ll be roaming the campus throughout the duration of the 8 days of activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An exchange service will be provided at the SmartCash booth as well at each booth where at least one dedicated SmartCash / Anglophone Union representative will be placed in order to render this service in a speedy and professional manner.</p>\n<p><strong><em><u>NB*</u></em></strong> - The proceeds from the sale of any SMART will go toward the future funding of the Union of Anglophone Students in Morocco&rsquo;s events. Any remaining SMART will be distributed to students as (hopefully the value of this currency is realised by the students) prizes during the proceeding summer activities. It is our expectation that some of our existing and new entrepreneurs continue accepting SMART as a payment method, thus creating continued demand for SMART amongst the campus population during the summer months, a period where students regularly find difficulty sustaining themselves and cash flow is generally halted since scholarship bursaries are not offered during this period.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is primarily in light of the absence of cash flow during the summer months why the <sup>1) </sup>distribution of food stuff during the Sharing is Caring campaign and the <sup>2)</sup> distribution of SMART among students coupled with the <sup>3)</sup> subvention of a few vendors / entrepreneurs is so important and, through the impact that SmartCash has on the students affected will be a lasting one and can only bode well for the SmartCash community as a whole in the long run, as well as feed and empower a lot of young people who are in need.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>15:00</em></p>\n<p><u>Sporting Activities:</u> Opening Matches Football and Volleyball</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>18:00</em></p>\n<p><u>Cultural Fashion Show and performances</u></p>\n<p>Each community will be invited to showcase their traditional dance.

Many of us are here without financial support from home and depend solely on the 1500 MAD bi-monthly stipend that is provided by the Moroccan government, this does not extend into the summer months and we need the students to open their eyes and start to think; think of better ways to sustain themselves as well as create wealth for themselves and their families.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Starting their own little businesses is one solution, they need to see that circulating the currency among themselves is an effective way to meet some of their needs, this behaviour will be encouraged by us the core team and volunteers until some of these small businesses spill out into the larger market&nbsp; that exists outside of the campus (we intend on hitting other campuses one by one after), they will be encouraged to let buyers know that they accept crypto as a payment option thus helping to remedy yet another major problem that exists here in the form of ignorance. The vast majority of the people here have never heard of or are not adequately educated about cryptocurrencies and the possibilities that such a fluid and near barrier free system exists, since currently the average Joe here cannot send money out of this country and has to face steep fees when receiving.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We need to get these young people to think and innovate so that they can then go out and make a difference. So far a few business ideas have been proposed by the students with whom I've spoken to, like small loans, catering, apparel, pooled mining and cloud mining services, speculative intermediation and investment services, even a local exchange.</p>\n<p>This is just the first of our initiatives and our long term vision is to instigate a culture of solution seekers whose eyes are not set on running to foreign lands to find greener pastures, but instead to seek to create their own, as well as find better solutions for real world issues like money transfer and income through non-traditional means such as online services and content/wealth creation.</p>",

Im looking for sponsorship to viability a new project to my channel, the idea is make videoclips saying about crypto to make people interested in invest them and enter into this market. But I will really need some financial help to hire a studio, and also a video editor. Im looking for an average of $15,000 yearly to produce 6 videoclips. With. With this amount smartcash will have exclusivity on videoclips, have the brand shown in mugs, shirts and another ideas. Here's an example of a musical video with smartcash participation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkYy1ZhcUKA). On video there's another project and companies participations, if this proposal is accepted my musical videos will be exclusive to the smartcash.

Currently I&rsquo;m working on my own veterinary clinic named Pet&rsquo;s Kingdom https://www.facebook.com/Petskingdomvet/ located in one of the most prestigious places in the city, offering a variety of services such as general medicine, alternative medicine, spa/grooming, recreational activities, lodging, etc. I&rsquo;m really interested in generate positive changes in the society both for SmartCash and population in general.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"file:///home/oscar/Descargas/petskingdom.jpg\" alt=\"This is my vet\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s put ourselves in context</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is estimated that in Mexico there are about 28 millions of pets (dogs and cats) of which 70% live on the street. Only in Mexico City there are nearly 1.2 millions of stray dogs, and that number increases 20% year over year, partly because they continue reproducing without any control.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I want to do is a Free Sterilization Campaign Sponsored by SmartCash so that people with low economic resources can sterilize their pets or take the stray dogs or cats that live in their neighborhood, contemplating performing 50 surgeries. In this way I will have a positive impact on the society and at the same time &nbsp;I will make a great diffusion about SmartCash.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average cost for one sterilization is $150 dlls, SmartCash will fund only 38% of the surgery cost and Pet&rsquo;s Kingdom will fund the rest. We will use the funds for surgery material, drugs, doctors fee, promotional material and staff.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to achieve a greater diffusion for SmartCash, I will collaborate with some really important nonprofit organizations interested in animal welfare and pet adoptions. Some of this organizations are &lsquo;Cambia un destino&rsquo; and &lsquo;Koncientizando&rsquo;, they are used to do massive adoption and sterilization campaigns on social networks. I am also going to publish an article on a mexican magazine for pet owners, about what is SmartCash and how it is going to help the society with this campaign.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, I&rsquo;m going to put SmartCash advertising stickers in my clinic and also in our social networks so that clients and people in general find out that we accept SmartCash as payment method. In this way I will start generating the SmartPet community in this important sector of the mexican population.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"file:///home/oscar/Descargas/petskingdom%202.jpg\" alt=\"We will accept SmartCash\" width=\"639\" height=\"639\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"file:///home/oscar/Descargas/17884067_1320836474674218_6749349060496069906_n.jpg\" alt=\"This is one of our surgery rooms\" width=\"639\" height=\"639\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the campaign day, a specialized staff will give a capacitation to the assistants supported by a video and flyers and will teach them what is SmartCash, how it works, what are the differences with other criptocurrencies.

These winners have shown that they are interested in growing their holdings.</li>\n<li>Because winners are educated about SmartCash and cryptocurrencies generally, they become advocates for the coin.</li>\n<li>SmartCash continued sponsorship of the course means that people will learn about SmartCash as their first coin when starting out.</li>\n<li>We will offer a new gateway for users to acquire SmartCash directly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you for the community support we have received to date.

            "description": "<p><strong>Quick Intro</strong></p>\n<p>My name is MJ, I studied Actuarial Science where one of the cornerstone subjects is Financial Economics. I'm focused on the application side of blockchain and how to integrate it into society.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Plan</strong></p>\n<p>The idea is to launch a series of interconnected SmartCash projects around Cape Town so that the city adopts the coin. This means getting merchant adoption, hosting events, setting up exchanges and prospecting for investors. Together these projects support one another and increase their effectiveness.</p>\n<p><strong>Merchant Adoption</strong></p>\n<p>Cape Town merchants have embraced mobile payment solutions and some having even started to accept bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies aren't a new concept to them and with the correct approach, we will be able to&nbsp;win&nbsp;them over to SmartCash.&nbsp; This means handing out booklets, having one on one discussions and giving them continuous support.</p>\n<p><strong>Hosting Events</strong></p>\n<p>Cape Townians understand the blockchain and many already have bitcoin. This means events can focus on explaining the unique benefits of SmartCash instead of trying to cover the basics of the technology. Cryptocurrency events have a large attendance and people here enjoy the networking benefits they offer.</p>\n<p><strong>Exchanges</strong></p>\n<p>It is tricky for South Africans to buy SmartCash. Not many of us have heard of the online exchanges that trade SmartCash and few will be prepared to trust them with serious amounts of money. For Urban Adoption to occur, there needs to be a local Bitcoin to SmartCash exchange as well as a local Fiat to SmartCash exchange. People need to buy the coin with ease and merchants must be able to sell the coin with ease.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting Investors</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm soon to become a Fellow Actuary of the Actuarial Society. This has taken me 8 years to accomplish and I've passed all the exams. In South Africa, actuaries are required by regulation to oversee the investments of large institutions. Our opinions matter. Once merchants have adopted SmartCash and an Exchange is up, I will do a write up of SmartCash for one of the financial magazines. In the article, I will outline the reasons for investing in SmartCash. I will also write about the risks. After this article, I will use my position to approach investment firms and make them aware of SmartCash. I will also speak at various investment seminars.</p>\n<p><strong>Budget</strong></p>\n<p>This is a big proposal and I understand that the amount required is higher than others. This isn't my first proposal and I know that SmartCash only reimburses me after I've supplied valid invoices. This reduces the risk that I take all the money and run. So you can rest assure&nbsp;that I'll only get paid after the work is done. Also, I'm budgeting for amounts Up To. This doesn't mean I'll receive all of it. The Fiscal officer of SmartCash does a great job in ensuring that proposals are not overpaid. The reason for an Up To budget is that I know from experience that there are often hidden costs that creep up on these types of projects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Merchant Adoption\n<ul>\n<li>Up to $5000 payment to team members after signing up 100 Merchants in Cape Town</li>\n<li>Up to $1000 for t-shirts, booklets and other adoption promoting material.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hosting Events\n<ul>\n<li>Up to $1000 for banners, snacks, rent, helpers</li>\n<li>Up to $1000 for advertising the event</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Exchange\n<ul>\n<li>Up to $3000 to set up an online exchange</li>\n<li>Up to $2000 to set up an offline exchange</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Investors\n<ul>\n<li>Up to $500 to write articles for financial magazines</li>\n<li>Up to $500 to approach investment firms</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Admin Costs\n<ul>\n<li>Up to $1900</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This brings the total to $15000.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Already Started</strong></p>\n<p>I'm already in the process of getting my family's Airbnb business on board, this will allow tourists to pay for accommodation with SmartCash. I'm attending an Actuarial Investment Seminar at the end of August where the topic is Cryptocurrencies. I've volunteered to be a speaker and will use the networking time to tell other investment professionals about SmartCash. I have a lot invested in SmartCash and I'm excited to be part of its success story.</p>\n<p><strong>Third Parties</strong></p>\n<p>I will be working with others to make this proposal a success. People will only be paid after a merchant is adopted. The online exchanges will be either an established one like Luno, or a new one like ZuluX. The exchanges need liquidity in order to make the markets and that has been priced in. The offline exchange will be a physical space in Cape Town where people can trade fiat for SmartCash.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>This is a big proposal and I do welcome your comments. I'm hoping that this proposal is a success and that it can be used as an example for other cities. Urban Adoption of cryptocurrency is happening, we need to act now and beat the other coins by setting up simultaneous projects that support each other. Vote Yes.</p>",

            "summary": "We are currently developing a web browser based (WebVR) 360 Video Editor with Smartcash InstantPay to solve the problem of easily creating VR enabled 360 videos with no technical skills required. 360 Videos are the new video media type used on platforms like Youtube 360, Facebook 360, etc. \n\nAs you all know, VR 360 videos and blockchain technologies are all classified as emerging high growth industries and so what better than to combine them together. \n",

Other than by using expensive and complicated video editing programs and or 3d engines like Unity and Unreal game engines. These all require a huge learning curve and high skill level to use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>**The Solution:**</strong></p>\n<p>We will provide users a FREE browser based (WebVR) editor to enable users create 360 video content easily with no technical skills required. Users will be able to showcase and monetize their 360 video templates using SmartCash InstantPay.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Who We Are:</strong> We are a group of five talented Engineers that have successfully built 3d applications and game engines, marketplace websites and WebVR 360 videos. We have two fullstack developers on our team, a front end developer proficient in Javascript and React as well as an MBA and a 3d /game engine developer.</p>\n<p>As you can see from the Editor screen shot above, we have already developed a significant portion of the WebVR editor. We initially tried to raise funds the traditional way but we were laugh at because we chose to switch to crypto (Smartcash) as our payment mechanism rather than using fiat.</p>\n<p>We explained that we wanted to be able to do micropayments using Smartcash for the trading of 360 video templates and assets within the WebVR editor just like how it works within most game engines. Thus, it wouldn&rsquo;t be viable for our users to pay using fiat payment options from platforms like PayPal that charge significant fees. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Smartcash Instant Pay is a better, faster and cheaper option and we love the direction and community here at Smartcash.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Deliverables/Job description:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>**The Ask:**</strong></p>\n<p>We will appreciate your help in voting for us to raise the requisite funds to complete just a few remaining milestones:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Complete development of WebVR editor and integrate SmartCash&rsquo;s InstantPay to be used as the payment mechanism so that users using our WebVR Editor can easily sell their 360 video templates and assets using Smartcash. This will also help with micro transaction payments. As well as allow users in several countries were traditional credit card payment options are a major impediment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Add functionality to enable the WebVR Editor to be used as a browser extension. Users will be able to use the WebVR Editor within major existing video platforms like YouTube (by simply clicking a button that has been added by the extension on the YouTube UI). This will allow a broader mass market use of the WebVR Editor with SmartCash InstantPay as the universal crypto currency payment feature.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i) Backend Developer &ndash; NODE JS/API Developer/WebVR: (120+ Hours):</p>\n<p>70,560 SMART</p>\n<p>ii) Design/Front End Developer &ndash; Javascript/ ReactJS/CSS/Images/360 Videos: (160+ Hours):</p>\n<p>94,080 SMART</p>\n<p>iii) Integration: API integrations, 3D Assets Integration, Video/Animation Timeline Development, Scripts Integration, etc. (120+ Hours):</p>\n<p>70,560 SMART</p>\n<p>iv) Testing &amp; Deployment: Test WebVR Editor, Launch/Bug Fix &amp; Support (70+ hours):</p>\n<p>41,090 SMART</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Possible FAQs:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why WebVR and 360 Videos?</strong></p>\n<p>We believe that in the future most websites will be developed in WebVR as 360 videos and virtual reality becomes more main stream. We also believe that Crypto currencies will be the main online payment mechanism.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What are your Future Plans after you successfully complete development and integrate SmartCash payment?</strong></p>\n<p>We will then like to be able to publish all the 360 videos created with the WebVR editor onto the blockchain. This is because blockchain ensures higher security of the assets as well as the transparency of transactions for copyrighted content though the watermarking and protection of intellectual property of the creators.</p>\n<p><strong>How can I help?</strong><br />You can help by voting <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Yes</span> for us and once it is live be among the first to use it to create your own amazing WebVR games and 360 video content.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>\n<p>We believe that with your help we can take the next step forward in promoting true&nbsp;decentralized payments in web applications with Smartcash.</p>",

These men had a tazer and a gun, and upon entering my home immediatly came into my room and jumped ontop of me while tazering me and trying to get me on my stomach and to stop fighting back, this eventually happens and they proceed to point a gun at me while threatening my life, family and so on. They used duct tape to tie me down to a chair for a little over 2 hours while they basically interrogated my crypto out of me. Police report is filed, money is in limbo and not even the SmartCash Devs cannot touch it even thought it is on a web wallet account due to my quick thinking. Sadly the money is locked behind a password that only the criminals would know, but they cannot use it because the username has changed, they also did not backup the key for the web wallet therefore have 0 access to the funds. Nor does anyone else... thats 14m coins just locked up.",
            "description": "<p>I have always been one of the guys who will happily get my hands dirty actually doing work for the community and would love to continue doing so on my own dime, but sadly I was robbed of 14,000,000 SmartCash on May 1st and have sort of kept quit about it due to a few reasons, one of which keeping it on the low while we tried to deal with it others ways...</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Well it has been 2 full months now and there isn't much happening, the cops have very little to go on, minus MAYBE a tiny amount of DNA from 1 perp. I have slowly gone broke and can likely only afford rent for a few more months until I am forced to find other sources of income and start from square 1 again.</p>\n<p>At one point the SmartCash team was open to funding my 50% proposal by themselves but something seems to have changed and rather than speculate on why or whom caused this, I was hoping I could just bring the proposal to the community, without drama, or arguments and just see what the tune of the community says about this..</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If not I completely understand and will do my best to maintain, but its not looking good. I even got up the nerve to call whom I thought it was who robbed me yesterday but that turned out to be a dead end. Not really sure what to do from here, cant exactly try to crack the password anymore than the devs already have due to web wallet security im essentially screwed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What do you guys think? Too much to ask? Should I just move on with my life? When you get robbed of 1.5 million dollars in one 3 hours period its a bit hard to come back from mentally and in general, working on the PTSD at 3am but it would really help ease my nerves if I knew the community had my back.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Police reports are already in place ( I can post proof if people reallly need it, but I have long since discussed this with the&nbsp; devs, the password has been attempted to be cracked and the devs swear there is NOTHING they can do to help me, so here we are.... Oh and obviously the coins were a perma hold. I had been working on my smartcash balance since LITERALLY before day one. :/</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the input, thanks guys and gals. And if this 'breaks' any rules just delete it and expect me to be LONG gone for that BS, so don't even try it please.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Oh and if you are curious as to why I didnt add to many details, I wanted you to actually read it, if you are curious just DM me.</p>",

Yay us!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>What is Slothicorn?</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slothicorn (<a href=\"http://www.slothicorn.com\">http://www.slothicorn.com</a>&nbsp;// <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@slothicorn\">https://steemit.com/@slothicorn</a>) is a decentralized, autonomous, loosely affiliated collective of artists who create art for cryptocurrency (often with a blockchain theme) or rewards other artists with cryptocurrency. We are rooted in the culture of open source and creative commons movements. Slothicorn seeks to liberate artists from daily grind and support them in higher quality of life by giving them the tools to create more abundance of resources, creativity, income, and support. Hopefully, these artists will become &ldquo;slothicorns&rdquo; themselves and help spread the wealth and community. Slothicorn often uses art projects, contests, bright colours, or crypto games to teach and share. Known for surreal and futuristic visuals, rainbow colours, and an outpouring of playful energy, Slothicorn strives to be the &ldquo;wonderland of the Blockchain&rdquo;. The ultimate goal of slothicorn is to take an artist from famine to enough fortune for them to uplift another artist in slothicorn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the combination of a sloth and unicorn has existed on the internet for some time, Slothicorn as we know it was born from a dream by Stellabelle(https://steemit.com/@stellabelle). Stellabelle first released Slothicorn onto the Steem Blockchain in late 2017 and it exploded into a large community of creatives who have, at the time of writing, rewarded artists with over 46,000 USD(https://steemit.com/slothicorn/@paulag/slothicorn-analysis-artists-project-on-steemit) for their artistic efforts.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drawing inspiration from the original off-white paper, Slothicorn&rsquo;s first project was the Slothicorn steemit account(https://steemit.com/@slothicorn) that funded many contests and now supports a steemit art curation, made possible by a generous steem power delegation from Stellabelle and the support of other slothicorns. Slothicorn has evolved from a creative commons and open source background to encouraging artists to choose their own licensing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can look back at the daily art curation on our Current Projects(</span><a href=\"https://slothicorn.com/current-projects/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://slothicorn.com/current-projects/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) &nbsp;page on the website, with translations and curations also available in Indonesian and Spanish. We have a Discord community of about 700 members and a Twitter, but Steemit is by far our most active social media platform with around 1900 followers.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Who are the artists?</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently the slothicorn tag on steemit receives around 80-100 submissions a day and at our last analysis about a month ago(https://steemit.com/slothicorn/@ghulammujtaba/slothicorn-weekly-art-curation-analysis-05-09-2018-to-05-15-2018), there were over 200 unique users using the tag. Most of the artists use english, though we have a large enough Spanish and Indonesian community that we have added curators specifically to create curation posts in those languages. We&rsquo;re interested in helping artists at all stages of their careers and frequently have artists from across the globe, including Nigeria and Venezuela.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Who am I?</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My name is Ciel. I&rsquo;ve been a driving force behind Slothicorn since Stellabelle was hired by Ono, along with Ghulam (one of our other curators). I&rsquo;ve been interested in crypto since 2013, but only been very active in the space since last year. I was introduced to SmartCash through Crypt0 on Youtube and I&rsquo;ve participated a bit in Team SmartCash, mostly writing short fiction. (Theodore and the Queen Bee </span><a href=\"https://steemit.com/smartcash/@justatouchfey/theodore-and-the-queen-bee-or-a-little-suspense-story-about-smartcash\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://steemit.com/smartcash/@justatouchfey/theodore-and-the-queen-bee-or-a-little-suspense-story-about-smartcash</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). I actually have another little serial I&rsquo;m in the process of (The Winter Hive </span><a href=\"https://steemit.com/smartcash/@justatouchfey/the-winter-hive-part-one-or-a-little-suspense-serial-involving-cryptos-and-smartcash\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://steemit.com/smartcash/@justatouchfey/the-winter-hive-part-one-or-a-little-suspense-serial-involving-cryptos-and-smartcash</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) though my Slothicorn work has put that on hold a bit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wrote those stories because I like SmartCash and found the community to be very approachable and encouraging. It was a great re-entry into cryptocurrency for me as a creative person and I think it would be very fun to introduce SmartCash to the Slothicorn community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside crypto, I&rsquo;m an artist and writer who has performed and exhibited work in Winnipeg, Vancouver, and Toronto. I&rsquo;ve been involved in everything from television production to immersive art installations. Besides my curating work with Slothicorn, I also co-created and helps maintain the CryptoKitties Wiki.(</span><a href=\"http://cryptokittieswiki.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http://cryptokittieswiki.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). You can check out the most recent version of my CV here: </span><a href=\"https://cielsaintemarie.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/cielsaintemarie_webcv.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://cielsaintemarie.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/cielsaintemarie_webcv.pdf</span></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Who are the curators?</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We currently have two english language curators (myself/@justatouchfey and Ghulam/@ghulammujtaba, one spanish language curator (@karmachela), and one indonesian curator(@kennyvaldez). The curators were chosen simply as the individuals who showed up every day to do the work.</span></p>",

            "summary": "This is an updated proposal.  After speaking with several members of the SmartHive, I believe that an EXCLUSIVE Reality Check sponsorship makes sense.  \n\nWe propose that just as SmartCash is helping to create disruption in the financial world, it also helps to create major disruption in the media world by becoming the exclusive sponsor of “Reality Check w/ Ben Swann.”  In order to fit into the SmartCash budget, we are proposing an exclusive sponsorship of Reality Check.  SmartCash will be branded and tied to what is one of the most successful news segments in the world. Our hope is to  establish and sustain a long-term partnership, and we would be honored to be an ambassador of SmartCash.\n\nReality Check with Ben Swann is a news and information segment that paved the way in covering stories mainstream media misrepresented or simply deceived the public about in the United States and around the world. In 2016, Reality Check with Ben Swann had 110 Million video views on Facebook and outperformed media giants such as VICE News.   \n\nFrom February to May of 2018 Reality Check with Ben Swann was sponsored by DASH Digital Cash and during that time Reality Check segments garnered over 20 Million views.  In addition, our brand partnership with DASH has introduced DASH as a brand to millions of new and potential crypto users.\n",

I became drawn to covering under-reported issues and events early on in my career, particularly during my time covering the drug war in Mexico when I realized that the war on drugs was being misrepresented and most mainstream media had no interest in upholding their commitment to sharing the truth with the public. I&rsquo;ve received three Emmy awards and two Edward R. Murrow awards, as well as several AP awards from my time in Texas and New Mexico and Georgia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am not new to the cryptocurrency community. I&rsquo;ve been discussing Bitcoin since 2013, longer and more thoroughly than most journalists in the media, in my own reporting as well as during my appearance at the Texas Bitcoin Conference in 2014. My experience stands in contrast to the majority of mainstream media, which is scrambling to catch up on coverage largely because cryptocurrency has become so accessible and attractive that they can no longer ignore it. However, the majority of media corporations fail to objectively and accurately report on this industry.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit to SmartCash</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have the ability to bring SmartCash to a vastly larger audience than ever before. &nbsp;From February to March of 2018 we had a similar sponsorship agreement with Dash Digital Cash. &nbsp;Without question we brought an enormous amount of attention to the Dash DAO with many media organizations and individuals now aware of the concept of a DAO treasury when they had not been in the past. &nbsp;In addition, we introduced DASH as a brand to millions of freedom and liberty minded individuals. Further, the addition of the Dash Spotlight in the final month of our sponsorship gave our viewers an intimate look at DASH and its benefits not only in terms of a financial option, but also as a way to expanding disruption and freedom throughout the world. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, Reality Check episodes dive into subjects that are embraced and heavily recirculated by an enormous and diverse crowd. This crowd comes from widely varying political, social and geographic backgrounds and they range from individuals who have spent a great deal of their own time on research to individuals who are learning about these subjects for the first time, and the subject of cryptocurrency is no exception. The promotion of SmartCash will fit seamlessly with our reporting: while our audience is diverse, it shares a common passion for disruption in the media as well as a mindset that embraces disruptive technologies like cryptocurrency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have the advantage of both a huge audience and existing experience in speaking to the public about cryptocurrency. Using the same footprint that has helped Reality Check and Truth In Media episodes reach hundreds of millions of viewers, we will be able to integrate SmartCash and crypto within our videos as well as bring those topics to live events at a more intimate level with the public. &nbsp;Our audience is comprised of millions of free thinkers and many people who either have or want to adopt cryptocurrency. Many of those individuals know very little about alternative currencies. Our Sponsor Spotlight provides important brand building information for those viewers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have been honored over the past 4 months to act as an ambassador for Dash and to introduce the power of Dash Digital Cash to so many people. I now look forward to moving forward as a brand ambassador for SmartCash and introducing millions of people worldwide to the SmartCash community and economy.</span></p>",

            "description": "<p><strong>The problem</strong><br />For years Ghana and most African countries has been pummeled with high unemployment. Lack of steady positions and corrupt business officials make it hard for entrepreneurs to make their mark on the continent, and Cryptocurrency has given many business owners and workers opportunity they likely wouldn&rsquo;t have had otherwise.<br />Cryptocurrency fever is now striking Africa hard. Ghana is one of the few countries in Africa where Cryptocurrency is picking up remarkably and yet, most people still hold a hostile attitude towards these digital currencies which still hinders the adoption rate in the country.<br />Based on our just completed proposal, it came to our notice that even though the knowledge of Cryptocurrency is rising, many people still don&rsquo;t know of Smartcash.<br />This project shall cover the 3 major industrialized and business areas of Ghana (Takoradi, Tema and Koforidua) for the next three months. Our earliest project&nbsp;<a href=\"Details/INTRODUCING-SMARTCASH-TO-THE-ASHANTI-COMMUNITY\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://vote.smartcash.cc/Proposal/Details/INTRODUCING-SMARTCASH-TO-THE-ASHANTI-COMMUNITY<span class=\"badge badge-notification clicks\" title=\"1 click\">1</span></a>&nbsp;is completed with all milestones and measure of success met with an increase awareness of Smartcash within the region. There is therefore the need to create more awareness on Smartcash and why Ghanaians should adopt and trade using Smartcash.<br />Several lessons and observations have been made for our first project and there is the need to factor in new development such as training Smartcash ambassadors, contracting bloggers to write on Smartcash and Smartcash radio advertisements.</p>\n<p><strong>Contracting bloggers to write on Smartcash</strong><br />Blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service. Bloggers do not only produce content to post on their blogs but also build social relations with their readers and other bloggers. This however create a great opportunity to advertise ones goods. We shall contract major bloggers to write and share Smartcash contents periodically. This will reach about 15000 Ghanaians and it will increase the adoption of Smartcash in Ghana.<br /><strong>Media advertisement</strong><br />Outreach is a major advantage with radio ads. Despite criticism for high costs. Advertisers have the best chance to reach large audience through television and radio. Radio advertisement can reach even the illiterates people in the country.<br />Smartcash radio and advertisement in the nations most watched and listened stations to help educate Ghanaians on Smartcash Cryptocurrency.<br /><strong>Ambassadors program</strong><br />For massive adoption and usability, there should be massive Smartcash advocacy in developing countries like Ghana. The country is not new to Cryptocurrency but most people are not aware of the impact of Smartcash. To be able to achieve this, ambassadors will be provided with training, funding and materials to perform their own meet-ups, thus exponentially increasing our influence. The project intend to train 30 Smartcash enthusiast to spread and educate the mass on Smartcash digital cash and to clear any misconceptions Ghanaians have on Smartcash Cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p><strong>Work done so far</strong> <br /><em>My team and I have been busy advocating Smartcash in Ghana and Ashanti region over the past three months where many Ghanaians have shown massive interest in the coin by signing up and buying Smart to be used for their daily transactions.</em><br /><a class=\"onebox\"

            "description": "<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.&rdquo;</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? R. Buckminster Fuller</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Hello SmartHive, we&rsquo;re Anti-Media</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much like cryptocurrencies, Anti-Media was born from the internet to disrupt the mainstream paradigm of centralization and control. As young people began to ask questions online about the status quo, we found a home in anti-establishment millennial circles that were looking for explanations of why the world is the way it is. Since we started as a non-partisan Facebook meme page in 2013, Anti-Media has grown into a leader in digital independent media, reaching over 12 million people every month. Our founder, Nick Bernabe, started the company after witnessing widespread shortcomings in politics and media during the U.S. elections in 2012. He had the the hope of challenging official narratives and injecting alternative voices into the conversations that shape our world. Five years later, Anti-Media is one of the most trusted and well-known brands in the industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our hard-hitting, non-sensationalized content is not only shared throughout our own network of two million+ followers but is also syndicated across hundreds of independent media websites and has been featured on and sourced by mainstream outlets such as </span><a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/black-market-drugs-drives-crime-stats-508340\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newsweek</span></em></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doctors-without-borders-bombing_us_5615690ce4b021e856d33d51\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huffington Post</span></em></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drudge Report</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yahoo</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Our content is also regularly shared by Ron Paul&rsquo;s outlets. Our </span><a href=\"http://theantimedia.org/the-team/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incredible team</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of writers, researchers, and editors features some of the most influential personalities in the liberty community, including </span><a href=\"http://theantimedia.org/author/careyw1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carey Wedler</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"http://theantimedia.org/author/derrickb1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Derrick Broze</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"http://theantimedia.org/author/josiew1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Josie Wales</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><a href=\"http://theantimedia.org/author/nickbernabe/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nick Bernabe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much like our team, our sizable following is made up of largely anti-establishment millennials who value freedom and decentralization. This is a perfect match for SmartCash.</span></p>\n<p><strong>SmartCash Sponsorship Proposal</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same way SmartCash seeks to disrupt the centralized financial system, Anti-Media seeks to disrupt the centralized media and information model. As SmartCash promotes freedom through decentralization and innovation, Anti-Media publishes content promoting the values of freedom and decentralization in everyday life by covering both threats to these values as well as developments that help to protect and nurture them. That is why we believe SmartCash sponsoring Anti-Media would be an ideal, mutually beneficial, and timely match for the visions of our organizations &mdash; especially as large ad networks continue to ban crypto advertising. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If SmartCash sponsors Anti-Media, our organizations will both thrive through this innovative new way to fund media and advertise cryptocurrencies. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-Media will remove advertisements from Google, Facebook, and other invasive ad companies from our platforms that we&rsquo;ve relied on for years to monetize our content. We&rsquo;ve become increasingly concerned with Google and Facebook censorship and data mining and would like to cease our use of them altogether. Removing these invasive ads and replacing them with ads for SmartCash will allow our advertisements to align with our values. </span><strong>Sponsoring Anti-Media will enable SmartCash to circumvent Google, Facebook, and Twitter bans on cryptocurrency advertisements.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It will also make our revenue model censorship-resistant.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-Media will publish a bi-weekly podcast sponsored by SmartCash</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SmartCash banner ads, videos, calls to action, SmartCash social media page @tags, and shoutouts will be strategically placed on our content across all platforms, from our website, </span><a href=\"http://theantimedia.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TheAntiMedia.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and viral memes and videos on </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheAntiMedia/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theantimedia/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/antimedia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to our newsletter with 50,000 subscribers, as well as </span><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@antimedia/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steemit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This </span><strong>provides us the ability to deliver well over 6 million impressions per month and monetize our influential social media reach.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We&rsquo;d be able to seamlessly plug SmartCash marketing graphics and videos (or have our graphic designer/video editor make the material) into our content, which is consumed by an audience that is already skeptical of the financial system and eager to find and support new solutions. SmartCash&rsquo;s social media profiles will receive many new followers from @tagging them on the various platforms. We will provide accounting for all impressions and actions taken on SmartCash advertisements across all platforms.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-Media will be able to increase the amount, quality, and distribution of our content, expand video programming, hire more prominent writers from the freedom community, increase our network reach, and acquire much more traffic and views for our content. We will be able reach for our goal of publishing 40 or more articles per week with at least one cryptocurrency-related article per day. We will publish at least three videos per week and dozens of potentially viral memes &mdash; all branded with a call to action to buy SmartCash when possible.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>SmartCash&rsquo; marketing materials will be put in front of over 6 million people every month</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and will reach an audience whose values already align with SmartCash&rsquo; core principles. We will sponsor certain articles and content strategically for high conversion rates to advertise across Google, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and other advertising networks to drive clicks to the SmartCash ads in our content, sending traffic to smartcash.cc or smartcash.cc/get-smartcash. As we scale up video programming and viral content, the potential to reach much more than 6 million people per month is essentially guaranteed. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-Media&rsquo;s core demographic is the </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewarnold/2018/01/07/30-of-millennials-invest-in-cryptocurrency-here-are-3-tips-to-help-you-do-it-smarter/#42cb710c7861\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most likely</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to embrace cryptocurrencies. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SmartCash press releases, updates, and announcements will all be covered by Anti-Media writers and turned into news articles, which will likely be syndicated by many other media sites that aggregate our content.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viral content, which will contain SmartCash advertising/branding/call to actions/social media @tags, will be shared with our larger network of distribution partners, which will likely result in </span><strong>hundreds of millions</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of impressions for the SmartCash brand. Our content is licensed creative commons, so viral content may be freely uploaded by many other publishers, influencers, and individuals, carrying SmartCash to an exponential number of impressions. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bonus: A project we&rsquo;re currently working on (but are unable to talk about publicly yet because of non-disclosure agreements) would provide massive, mainstream visibility to SmartCash if and when it comes to fruition. Our SmartCash sponsorship would be &ldquo;grandfathered&rdquo; into that project. This is not guaranteed but would be a gamechanger for both of our organizations&rsquo; name-recognition, branding, and reach.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What are we asking for?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accomplish all we set out to do with this sponsorship, we are requesting:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>100,000 SMART per month</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-SmartCash banner ads will be placed in our content. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-Social media content (viral in many cases) would be branded with SmartCash.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-Anti-Media podcast sponsored by SmartCash</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-Approximately 6 million+ impressions per month for the SmartCash brand. (Many ads on websites generate $10 CPM, which is $10 per 1,000 impressions. We&rsquo;re offering a conservative estimate of 6 million impressions, which would be valued at $60,000 per month by this metric, providing extraordinary value.)</span></p>\n<p><strong>How the funds would be spent (monthly estimates)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-Media team wages (writers, editors, social media managers, video editor, new hires, etc.): 50,000 SMART </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing (with an emphasis on SmartCash ad conversions): 20,000 SMART </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operating expenses: 10,000 SMART</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resources to scale up operations: 10,000 SMART </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research and development: 5,000 SMART</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Networking: 5,000 SMART</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&rsquo;ll utilize SMART as our official currency and use it to spend our budget when possible, including paying Anti-Media team wages.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Fluctuations in the price of SMART will be either absorbed by Anti-Media if the price goes down or put toward increasing traffic and impressions (marketing) if the price goes up. In the event of a dramatic change in SMART value, the amounts could be renegotiated in a new proposal.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Terms</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4-month trial period (one month for us to scale-up, 3 months to collect and report data to SmartCash). If the sponsorship proves to be satisfactory for both parties, we&rsquo;d like to extend it another 8 months with a new proposal. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will maintain transparent accounting. Spending and advertising/branding/impression data will be shared with SmartCash.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks for taking the time to read our proposal, SmartHive! We look forward to working together to bring cryptocurrency and blockchain to the masses.</span></p>",

            "summary": "INTRODUCTION\nHi fellow Smarties, I am Adeleke Saheed, popularly known in the SmartCash community as @kingcrypto from Nigeria, West Africa. I am a Crypto-advocate, a Monetary Economist by profession, an Event planner by practice, a Data scientist and financial analyst, and a father. Since I discovered Smartcash, a decentralized economy with it huge potential, I have decided to stay around and succeed with the Smartcash family, and this is my pledge to you all.\nAfter realizing there is little awareness and adoption of SmartCash cryptocurrency in Nigeria, I have decided to create the required mass awareness for SmartCash cryptocurrency and promote its adoption among fellow Nigerians with the power of public media. By this, I have started raising new local Smartcash vanguards and ambassadors who will support me in execution of this project and join the Smartcash mass awareness campaign training.\n\nDESCRIPTION\nPublic media (use of television and radio) has been a good innovation and an efficient means of advertising and marketing of businesses, products and services across the world today. Thus, the effects of public media promotion in business growth is inevitable in today’s world and has been the key factor that drive the positive trend of information growth.\n\nTHE PROBLEM\nI am a member of the Smartcash community who lives in Lagos State, Nigeria. I have attended some projects and seminars generally on the future of cryptocurrency in Nigeria. In addition, I have been to the streets of Lagos to meet with individuals, firms and business owners to make rapt survey on cryptocurrency adoption and use in Nigeria, with major reference to Smartcash cryptocurrency. However, my study has shown to a great length that Smartcash cryptocurrency adoption and usage is quite low in Nigeria and requires urgent attention.\n\nTHE PROJECT (SMS - NIGERIA): WHAT WILL WE DO?\nA standard survey of Lagos according to Geopoll Media survey shows that about 78% of the Lagosians own and watches television and about 85% of the population listens to radio which makes these two media, an effective and efficient means of information outreach for Smartcash cryptocurrency. I have intended to run this project for two (2) months with my team members which I am raising and training, and which the continuation of this project in the future will be based on the community’s decisions about the achievements and outcomes of this current proposed project. The project targets the Lagos state residents, business owners, Crypto-enthusiast, firms, merchants, local exchanges and students, all in Lagos State.\nThis project will feature:\n•             An Eight-weeks “Smartcash Home drive” on the radio with Kingcrypto.\n•             An Eight-weeks “Smartcash TV series” with Kingcrypto.\n•             A Smartcash Public Seminar/workshop for business owners, firms, local exchanges, merchants and private individuals in Lagos State.\nAll video report of the programs will be shared on all official SmartCash sources. In addition, written reports will be made and submitted concerning each week media programs.\n\nMY SMARTCASH ACTIVITIES\nhttps://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1l-svmZbQzL6rSU1z0uqnAOTZRKzvBuMc\nhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=136252553917523&id=100025983366541\n",

The power of internet radio services added to radio stations services and cable televisions in Nigeria will enable people within and outside the Lagos states and Smartcash community members to listen to the radio shows and watch the television series broadcast.

            "summary": "The adoption of Africa seem different from other parts of the world and other continent. The kind of software and marketing ideas that work well in Other parts of the world may seem not to function well down here. This project seeks to promote SmartCash ecosystem and technology and also to bring new computer engineers, software developers, programmers and other stakeholders to build new software to help move the massive adoption in Africa at a faster pace.This project also seek to  bring developers together to compete for a price in SmartCash. \nFor those of as who are not familiar with hackathon, is an event where a group of individuals gather for 24-48 hours to build projects from start to finish to be submitted for judging and prizes. Hackathon events are typically free to attend, with all necessary transportation, venues, chairs, tables, food, electricity, etc. funded by sponsors. Typically sponsors are TECH companies that use the opportunity to circulate their brand with students,organizations, corporate bodies and the general public to seek out hiring candidates, and to encourage innovations. Frequently, sponsors also offer prizes for the best use of their API,technology or platform(eg. IBM might offer a prize for the best use of their cloud services)",
            "description": "<p>Preamble<br /> My name is Kingsford Yankson cryptocurrency enthusiasts and an ambassador for smartcash known on discord as <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.smartcash.cc/u/yankdiary\">@yankdiary</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Background</span></strong><br /> After the failure of the first proposal, \" Building software for the Africa ecosystem of SmartCash\", some community members contacted me to bring up the proposal again since the idea behind the proposal was good and can aid in the massive adoption of SmartCash in Africa. Some concerns raised by some community members was that the proposal was not well elaborated for easy understanding in which led to its failure. This is a vivid and restructured proposal of the previous one. We realize that there is a gap between native developers in Africa and blockchain technology (cryptocurrency). For technology like SmartCash whose competency lies on innovative ideas and new technology, we therefore saw that there is the need to bridge that gap.Thinking of what to do we decided to organize a hackathon with workshop and extensive education to integrate this native developers into the ecosystem of SmartCash. We also realize that massive adoption can be achieved in different ways and in different regions taking into consideration the system of transaction pratice in that particular region. For instance the likes of card (debitcard, mastet, smartcard)etc, have contributed well in the massive adoption of SmartCash in Europe and America but when this same system is applied in Africa its hard to yield any result. This is why we want to organize this competition to bring native developers on board who will create softwares to integrate the SmartCash into the way of life of the people (economic culture) but not telling or force them to abandoned theirs completely. That is, we seeking to bring developers onboard to generate and brainstorm ideas that will integrate how the people of Africans spend, save and make day to day fiat transaction into Smartcash ecosystem system. For example, in Ghana over 80% of the total population deals with mobile money banking and transaction and so if a software is been created to include smartcash in this mobile money banking which will make it easy for smartcash users to do transaction day in and day out, then we are not far from achieving massive adoption and usage of smartcash in Ghana.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How we will do it</strong><br /> We (my team and I) aim to organize competition for the developers. We are expecting not more than 50 developers and they will be competing for a price in SmartCash</p>\n<p>The judges for the competition will be pioneers for smartcash Africa and other Outstanding developers in Africa.</p>\n<p>Email and letters have been sent to the various software developers in Ghana and Head of department of the various IT universities to let outstanding developers students to also partake in the competition. The letters were sent to them with the theme of the competition attached to it. This will enable the developers for the competition to get prepare with their innovative ideas to execute.</p>\n<p>The theme for this Hackathon is &ldquo;consumer finance?.&rdquo; We are challenging them to think of some glaring problem in the consumer finance in Africa that can be solved using blockchain technology.(SmartCash)</p>\n<p>For example, perhaps you want to fix peer-to-peer lending or create a way for individuals to fund each others&rsquo; mortgages, instead of banks. Or maybe you want to revolutionize how auto loans work using the blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>You can build an App that uses blockchain technology to solve a problem in any area of consumer finance in Africa but the problem you choose to solve is up to you!</p>\n<p>Workshops<br /> The competition will be integrated with a series of talks, workshops and advice on challenges related with the smartcash platform in Africa, this will be related to integrate new ideas and hacks in the SmartCash platform. This workshop and talk is to enlighten the developers about SmartCash and also educates them on technical issues concerning SmartCash.</p>\n<p>This Hackathon will be smartcash branded completely, all participants will receive swag from smartcash with all event and staff wearing the logo of Smartcash.</p>\n<p>After the competition teams will show their projects to each other and the judges. They are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what they have built. Pitch or presentation are also encouraged. But they will not be judge base on the quality of the pitch but base on what you have built even if broken or you weren&rsquo;t able to finish. Completion is only one part of the criteria, they must also present a demo, that is very necessary. Remember, hacking is about building and learning not about selling.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Deliverables(Goals)</strong><br /> Give awareness about the development needs for the SmartCash ecosystem in Africa.</p>\n<p>Evangelizing developers about the SmartCash project in general and its key learnings to generate impact</p>\n<p>Generate important hackers for the SmartCash community</p>\n<p>Have fun with hacking in the SmartCash platform</p>\n<p>Discover new integrations and development opportunities</p>\n<p>Open the SmartCash development in general to the local community</p>\n<p><strong>Agenda</strong><br /> Friday 6 PM to Saturday 8:00 PM<br /> Friday<br /> 6:00 PM Registration<br /> 7:00 PM Opening<br /> 8:00 PM Conference 1<br /> 9:00 PM Workshop 1<br /> 10:00 PM Dinner<br /> 11:00 PM Workshop 2<br /> 12:00 PM Workshop 3</p>\n<p>Saturday<br /> 8:00 AM Breakfast<br /> 10:00 AM Mentors Panel<br /> 11:00 AM Workshop 4<br /> 1:00 PM Mentors Panel<br /> 4:00 PM Hacks Registration<br /> 5:00 PM Hacks Presentation<br /> 6:00 PM Hacks Judging<br /> 7:00 PM Winners Announcement Awards<br /> 8:00 PM Closing Ceremony</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Stakeholders</span> </strong></p>\n<p>Programmers<br /> I T students<br /> Computer engineers<br /> Graphic designers<br /> General public<br /> Software developers</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Activities</strong></span></p>\n<p>Workshops - This would be a series of preparation talks given to the teams that will be participating on the Hackathon, with technical specs.</p>\n<p>Hackathon - Programming session will go from x to y pm. Teams will be assembled and coding sessions will go on for the remainder of the day.</p>\n<p>Award session - Closing of the event as well as evaluation of the code from Judges and final award to the teams.</p>\n<p>Judging session - This will be a space to have the core developers to Judge and participate in the judging session. They will be key part of the winners decision.</p>\n<p><strong>Judging criteria for the competition</strong></p>\n<p>Technology<br /> How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go &ldquo;Wow&rdquo;?</p>\n<p>Viability<br /> Does the project has a realistic chance of being implemented by partners? Is the idea scalable and applicable to more industries? Is it realistic to further develop the project?</p>\n<p>Originality<br /> Is your project creative, new and innovative? Is it something we already know or is the idea disruptive?</p>\n<p>UX<br /> How is the design and user experience of your project? Is it easy to understand and use?</p>\n<p>Wow-effect<br /> Can you amaze the judges with new use-cases, big opportunities or surprises? How much did you achieve during the competition</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Objective(in business terms)</strong></span><br /> The ROI is very great and enormous to smartcash and its community in Africa at large. Developers will be motivated to code in their own language. The benefits to Smartcash are:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Developer Engagement</strong></em><br /> The competition will build a bridge to the developer community.<br /> For cryptocurrency like Smartcash whose competencies lie in providing technology solutions, this competition help establish two-way conversations between those that develop the technology (APIs, APKs, data sets etc) and the people that use them. This feedback loop increases developer adoption, which is crucial if solutions are to proliferate across new channels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Corporate Branding<br /></strong>Associating your brand with a competition like this can change the public&rsquo;s perception of your brand and help acquire developer mindshare. Hosting a competition or getting involved as a sponsor is an efficient way to deliver more awareness about your coin to a prime, target audience &ndash; the maker community &ndash; and increase brand exposure in the tech world.</p>\n<p><strong>IP Development</strong><br /> This competition is great, not necessarily because the silver bullet will be found, but because participants may find something you never knew you were looking for. This may be using your software solutions to break into new markets or developing extensions that open up entire new customer bases.<br /> In addition, participants often not only develop a prototype of an app but frequently its infrastructure as well. This competition can build a genuine business case for the submission that justifies and facilitates further development and investment in the team that provided the solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Recruitment</strong><br /> As project-based challenges, this competition come closest to testing a candidate&rsquo;s capabilities of handling challenges in the workplace.<br /> With software developers and data scientists in high demand, it&rsquo;s challenging for companies to gain exposure, garner interest and determine the best talent. This competition can address both challenges. It will enable the SmartCash community to gain awareness in the developer community and are perceived as &ldquo;hacker-friendly&rdquo;. This helps attract top talent and once the candidates apply, they have at least one project under their belt and have proven to be passionate enough about their work to spend a weekend with little to no sleep. With this, looking for software developers to create software for the ecosystem of SmartCash in the future will be simple.</p>\n<p><strong>Justification (success criteria)</strong><br /> Videos and pictures will be sent to the various community of smartcash during when the competition is ongoing. There will be live streaming of the competition on facebook and twitter.<br /> Developers who will show outstanding performance will be introduced to the Smartcash community for further collaborations with other developers of SmartCash.<br /> All code will be uploaded to GITHUB or other public sources for future references.</p>\n<p><strong>Communication strategy</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m on Discord, Facebook, Twitter and SmartCash forum as <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.smartcash.cc/u/yankdiary\">@Yankdiary</a><br /> <a href=\"mailto:Yanksonkingsford@yahoo.com\">Yanksonkingsford@yahoo.com</a> is my current, active and personal email.</p>\n<p><strong>Budget</strong></p>\n<p>venue: Renting the venue will need to have AC and good lighting and space with electrical cable to plug in and get wifi. Routers and Wifi equipment will be needed for networking. We will allocate a budget for 50 people<br /> Prizes: first prize $1000, 2nd prize $500 and 3rd prize $200 (all in SmartCash) other souvenirs will also be given to other teams.</p>\n<p>Staff : People assisting the teams as well as helping with organization, design, subscriptions recordings and such. We think a staff of 3-5 people. With a budget of 350 USD.</p>\n<p>Gear (screen, projectors, banners, etc): We want to make sure SmartCash branding is well represented on the event. We think on 2 smaller banners, bigger one and roll up banner will be enough.</p>\n<p>Participant Kit: T-shirt, Pen, Bag , all SmartCash Branded<br /> Also there will be radio/advertisements about the hackathon to also attract top talent and more people to the venue. With this as we are developing we are also doing marketing</p>\n<p>Venue $600 for two days</p>\n<p>Award for the winners $1700</p>\n<p>2 Software Developers and 2 data scientists + 5 Judges. $416</p>\n<p>Refreshments $513</p>\n<p>Banners $248</p>\n<p>Photographer $115</p>\n<p>Staff 3-5 people $350</p>\n<p>Transportation within the region $360</p>\n<p>Smartcash shirt, pen, stickers and bag $421</p>\n<p>advertising the competition (Radio and Television) $319</p>\n<p>Subtotal $5042</p>\n<p>5% contigency of the subtotal $270.1</p>\n<p><strong>Total</strong> $5312.1</p>\n<p>My team and I aim at extending this project to other Africa countries. But since this is my first project I want to see my performance in this mini project before I roll in another one.<br /> We aim at completing the SmartCash road map which state that developing local base multi currency wallet with trading abilities.</p>",

They are fresh students and do not probably have any idea about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

We will achieve this through workshops, radio discussions and meet-ups in five different halls of residents within the University. Our main target is newly admitted students because they were not present on campus during previous SmartCash outreach programs. With this project, these fresh students will get exposure and probably invest in SmartCash before getting to know of other alt-coins thereby giving SmartCash the First Mover Advantage.",
            "description": "<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>\n<p>I am Alhassan Abdul Basit on facebook ((<a href=\"https://web.facebook.com/alhassan.abdulbasit.77\">https://web.facebook.com/alhassan.abdulbasit.77</a>) and @Mr. SmartCash on the SmartCash Discord community. I am a graduand in Bachelor of Commerce and a campus ambassador of SmartCash in the University of Cape Coast. I am currently a service personnel at the School of Business in the University. Ever since I had exposure to SmartCash, I have always been a SmartCash advocate because I believe that SmartCash is the future and a real example of a 21<sup>st</sup> century currency because of its incentivized and decentralized nature. I have worked with some SmartCash advocates in Ghana and I strongly believe that I can play an active role in expanding the SmartCash community base by intensively promoting SmartCash inside the University of Cape Coast and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>What do we want to bring on board?</strong></p>\n<p>Our aim is to ensure massive adoption and usability of SmartCash within the University community by organizing conferences/seminars in all five (5) selected halls of residents including radio discussions on campus to educate and practically train fresh University students, hall administrators, hall bursars, merchants, e.t.c. on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology especially SmartCash. This project will target fresh students at hall levels due to the large size of the University with geographically dispersed students.</p>\n<p>This will help trigger the invasion of SmartCash as a generally accepted medium of exchange and also educate students on all the benefits and merits of using SmartCash against other cryptocurrencies. Our main target is newly admitted students because they were not present on campus during previous SmartCash outreach programs.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you want to know more about the University of Cape Coast (UCC)?</strong></p>\n<p>The University of Cape Coast (<a href=\"https://www.ucc.edu.gh/aboutus/about-ucc\">https://www.ucc.edu.gh/aboutus/about-ucc</a>) is one of the largest tertiary institutions in Ghana, West Africa, with an incremental annual enrollment status of about 15,650 students. The university, which is five kilometers west of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Coast\">Cape Coast</a>, is on a hill overlooking the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean\">Atlantic Ocean</a>. It operates on two campuses: the Southern Campus (Old Site) and the Northern Campus (New Site). The University is very large with geographically dispersed students. Fresh students reside in Halls while continuing students live in hostels within the University community.</p>\n<p>The large numbers of students that graduate every year from this University and other Ghanaian Universities create a lot of competition in the job market which leaves a lot of graduates unemployed after their University education. Due to the fear of being unemployed after school, students are now developing insatiable appetite for entrepreneurship while tertiary institutions are now establishing platforms to encourage innovation, creativity as well as job creation after school. Just like any other platforms that incite creative ideas, the SmartHive proposal projects and other investment opportunities on SmartCash provide absolutely excellent opportunities for students to pursue their goals of attaining financial freedom after school. This provides a good reason to introduce SmartCash to these fresh University students as they start their journeys to getting their first degree.</p>\n<p>The good news is that most University students have laptops and smart phones and are actively involved in conversations on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Also, First year students reside in Halls with wireless internet connection which creates room for all-day internet connectivity. These serve as opportunities to introduce cryptocurrencies especially SmartCash to these fresh students since they have the needed devices and facilities to join the incentivized and decentralized community.</p>\n<p><strong>What is our action plan?</strong></p>\n<p>All participants of the project will be educated about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. They will also be given exclusive education and training on SmartCash, how to set up wallets and ways they can also contribute to the incentivized and decentralized community through proposal writing on the SmartHive. The education and training outline for participants is detailed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>30 minutes radio discussion on Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies with much emphasis on SmartCash and why it is preferred to other cryptocurrencies. We will utilize the campus radio (<a href=\"http://www.atlfmonline.com/\">http://www.atlfmonline.com/</a> ) since it is located inside the University. The radio discussion will have coverage of about 40,000 people with calls in sessions.</li>\n<li>SmartCash WhatsApp/Facebook groups shall be created for each hall of residence where members in the same hall can share their knowledge on SmartCash.</li>\n<li>At the seminars/workshops, all participants will be given a general education on the Blockchain technology and crypto currencies. They will be lectured on SmartCash and given practical training on how to set up SmartCash wallets and its features, how to send/receive SmartCash, buying/selling SmartCash on local exchanges and the merits of choosing SmartCash over other Crypto Currencies. Participants will also be educated on why they should invest in SmartCash with respect to SmartRewards and SmartHive projects.</li>\n<li>Participants will also be guided on how to develop ideas and proposals that can promote the SmartCash agenda.</li>\n<li>Participants who prove serious and interested in the idea of SmartCash will be chosen as representatives of SmartCash in each of the halls of residence.</li>\n<li>Hall administrators, bursars, merchants, businesses and hall executives in each hall will also be involved. Bursars will be educated on why they should accept payments in SmartCash.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Are we informed enough to educate others about SmartCash?</strong></p>\n<p>It is important to note that whether someone accepts SmartCash or not depends on how the person is introduced to it. If the person gets a good and understandable introduction, they are more likely to accept SmartCash. Apart from the training acquired during the SmartCash outreach programs as ambassadors, we have done our homework and extensive research on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology especially SmartCash just to get a better understanding of what we are about to market to others.</p>\n<p>Also, to ensure effectiveness and success in &lsquo;winning more souls to SmartCash&rsquo;, we have formed a team made up of students from different cultural, academic and religious backgrounds so as to overcome the problem of groupthink associated with lack of diversity. It is also important to note that we have students from humanities, social sciences and arts that can impact in making this project a success by pooling expertise from marketing, journalism, public relations, event management, human relations and many more.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline for the project:</strong></p>\n<p>The education and training will be held in five (5) different halls of residents with a first year student population of about 1050&nbsp; each.

Some concerns raised by some community members was that the proposal was not well elaborated for easy understanding in which led to its failure. This is a vivid and restructured proposal of the previous one. We realize that there is a gap between native developers in Africa and blockchain technology (cryptocurrency). For technology like SmartCash whose competency lies on innovative ideas and new technology, we therefore saw that there is the need to bridge that gap.Thinking of what to do we decided to organize a hackathon with workshop and extensive education to integrate this native developers into the ecosystem of SmartCash. We also realize that massive adoption can be achieved in different ways and in different regions taking into consideration the system of transaction pratice in that particular region. For instance the likes of card (debitcard, mastet, smartcard)etc, have contributed well in the massive adoption of SmartCash in Europe and America but when this same system is applied in Africa its hard to yield any result. This is why we want to organize this competition to bring native developers on board who will create softwares to integrate the SmartCash into the way of life of the people (economic culture) but not telling or force them to abandoned theirs completely. That is, we seeking to bring developers onboard to generate and brainstorm ideas that will integrate how the people of Africans spend, save and make day to day fiat transaction into Smartcash ecosystem system. For example, in Ghana over 80% of the total population deals with mobile money banking and transaction and so if a software is been created to include smartcash in this mobile money banking which will make it easy for smartcash users to do transaction day in and day out, then we are not far from achieving massive adoption and usage of smartcash in Ghana.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How we will do it</strong><br /> We (my team and I) aim to organize competition for the developers. We are expecting not more than 50 developers and they will be competing for a price in SmartCash</p>\n<p>The judges for the competition will be pioneers for smartcash Africa and other Outstanding developers in Africa.</p>\n<p>Email and letters have been sent to the various software developers in Ghana and Head of department of the various IT universities to let outstanding developers students to also partake in the competition. The letters were sent to them with the theme of the competition attached to it. This will enable the developers for the competition to get prepare with their innovative ideas to execute.</p>\n<p>The theme for this Hackathon is &ldquo;consumer finance?.&rdquo; We are challenging them to think of some glaring problem in the consumer finance in Africa that can be solved using blockchain technology.(SmartCash)</p>\n<p>For example, perhaps you want to fix peer-to-peer lending or create a way for individuals to fund each others&rsquo; mortgages, instead of banks. Or maybe you want to revolutionize how auto loans work using the blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>You can build an App that uses blockchain technology to solve a problem in any area of consumer finance in Africa but the problem you choose to solve is up to you!</p>\n<p>Workshops<br /> The competition will be integrated with a series of talks, workshops and advice on challenges related with the smartcash platform in Africa, this will be related to integrate new ideas and hacks in the SmartCash platform. This workshop and talk is to enlighten the developers about SmartCash and also educates them on technical issues concerning SmartCash.</p>\n<p>This Hackathon will be smartcash branded completely, all participants will receive swag from smartcash with all event and staff wearing the logo of Smartcash.</p>\n<p>After the competition teams will show their projects to each other and the judges. They are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what they have built. Pitch or presentation are also encouraged.

This project seeks to promote SmartCash ecosystem and technology and also to bring new computer engineers, software developers, programmers and other stakeholders to build new software to help move the massive adoption of SmartCash in Africa at a faster pace.This project also seek to bring developers together to compete  so that their project, innovations and ideas will be used and or bought for further development\nFor those of as who are not familiar with hackathon, is an event where a group of individuals gather for 24-48 hours to build projects from start to finish to be submitted for judging and prizes. Hackathon events are typically free to attend, with all necessary transportation, venues, chairs, tables, food, electricity, etc. funded by sponsors. Typically sponsors are TECH companies that use the opportunity to circulate their brand with students,organizations, corporate bodies and the general public to seek out hiring candidates, and to encourage innovations. Frequently, sponsors also offer prizes for the best use of their API,technology or platform(eg. IBM might offer a prize for the best use of their cloud service) ",

Some concerns raised by some community members was that the proposal was not well elaborated for easy understanding in which led to its failure. This is a vivid and restructured proposal of the previous one. We realize that there is a gap between native developers in Africa and blockchain technology (cryptocurrency). For technology like SmartCash whose competency lies on innovative ideas and new technology, we therefore saw that there is the need to bridge that gap.Thinking of what to do we decided to organize a hackathon with workshop and extensive education to integrate this native developers into the ecosystem of SmartCash. We also realize that massive adoption can be achieved in different ways and in different regions taking into consideration the system of transaction pratice in that particular region. For instance the likes of card (debitcard, mastet, smartcard)etc, have contributed well in the massive adoption of SmartCash in Europe and America but when this same system is applied in Africa its hard to yield any result. This is why we want to organize this competition to bring native developers on board who will create softwares to integrate the SmartCash into the way of life of the people (economic culture) but not telling or force them to abandoned theirs completely. That is, we seeking to bring developers onboard to generate and brainstorm ideas that will integrate how the people of Africans spend, save and make day to day fiat transaction into Smartcash ecosystem system. For example, in Ghana over 80% of the total population deals with mobile money banking and transaction and so if a software is been created to include smartcash in this mobile money banking which will make it easy for smartcash users to do transaction day in and day out,(eg swift from SmatCash to fiat and fiat to SmatCash easily without any difficulties) then we are not far from achieving massive adoption and usage of smartcash in Ghana.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How we will do it</strong><br /> We (my team and I) aim to organize competition for the developers. We are expecting not more than 50 developers and they will be competing for a price in SmartCash</p>\n<p>The judges for the competition will be pioneers for smartcash Africa and other Outstanding developers in Africa.</p>\n<p>Email and letters have been sent to the various software developers in Ghana and Head of department of the various IT universities to let outstanding developers students to also partake in the competition. The letters were sent to them with the theme of the competition attached to it. This will enable the developers for the competition to get prepare with their innovative ideas to execute.</p>\n<p>The theme for this Hackathon is &ldquo;consumer finance?.&rdquo; We are challenging them to think of some glaring problem in the consumer finance in Africa that can be solved using blockchain technology.(SmartCash)</p>\n<p>For example, perhaps you want to fix peer-to-peer lending or create a way for individuals to fund each others&rsquo; mortgages, instead of banks. Or maybe you want to revolutionize how auto loans work using the blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>You can build an App that uses blockchain technology to solve a problem in any area of consumer finance in Africa but the problem you choose to solve is up to you!</p>\n<p>Workshops<br /> The competition will be integrated with a series of talks, workshops and advice on challenges related with the smartcash platform in Africa, this will be related to integrate new ideas and hacks in the SmartCash platform. This workshop and talk is to enlighten the developers about SmartCash and also educates them on technical issues concerning SmartCash.</p>\n<p>This Hackathon will be smartcash branded completely, all participants will receive swag from smartcash with all event and staff wearing the logo of Smartcash.</p>\n<p>After the competition teams will show their projects to each other and the judges. They are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what they have built. Pitch or presentation are also encouraged. But they will not be judge base on the quality of the pitch but base on what you have built even if broken or you weren&rsquo;t able to finish. Completion is only one part of the criteria, they must also present a demo, that is very necessary.

            "description": "<p>&gt; **INTRODUCTION**</p>\n<p>Abasinkanga Resteem Service (@abasinkanga) on steemit.com has 6700 followers as at the time of writing this proposal, 5 to 20 new followers are added to my account on a daily basis through my regular resteems, and posting comments on resteemed posts along with other promotional efforts to make the resteem service the most popular resteem service on steemit.</p>\n<p>**My resteem service aims at leveraging on its large number of followers to increase the popularity and quicken adoption of SMARTCASH on steemit.**</p>\n<p>&gt; **About Abasinkanga Resteem Service:**</p>\n<p>The standard fee for a post resteem is 0.1 SBD. We have a discord server</p>\n<p>&gt; **My contribution to SMARTCASH growth so far:**</p>\n<p>I started the Smartcash reward for resteem service since the 1st of May, 2018. Within that period a total of 391 smarts was distributed as follows:<br />May: 128 smarts<br />June: 129 smarts<br />July: 134 smarts so far</p>\n<p>Visit link to see proof that i actually do carry out these resteems and reward smartcash accordingly. Historical link to reports for the month of July are found at the bottom of the post here:<br />https://steemit.com/smartcash/@abasinkanga/100-report-my-resteem-service-gives-you-a-daily-passive-income-with-each-post-you-resteem-sunday-22nd-monday-23rd-july-2018</p>\n<p>&gt; **My Proposal for SmartCash:**</p>\n<p>* Every steemit user that pays me for a post resteem should be rewarded SMARTCASH (1 SMART per post resteemed)<br />* A comment stating the user has received a smartcash reward for using my resteem service, and command menus for accessing his smartcash will be made on his post.</p>\n<p>* I am requesting that the smartcash community approve a total of 600 smartcash for a 3 months campaign of resteeming smartcash posts. <br />* A total of +/-200 smartcash is budgeted for each month, but depending on requests from steemit users (those who pay for resteems), we may actually spend less than or more than that each month. <br />* After the 3 months period, this proposal should be reviewed, and if necessary an upward or downward review of smartcash amount allocated per month, should be approved and disbursed for another 3 months campaign.</p>\n<p>**Breakdown of Proposal Implementation Costs:**<br />1. Cost of promoting \"Smartcash For Resteem\" posts with other resteem services<br />other resteem services charge between 0.05 SBD and 0.2 SBD to resteem posts. I will bear the cost of running promotions for my resteem service, as my own contribution to the success of this proposal</p>\n<p>2. Cost of rewarding users smartcash for using my resteem service:<br />The 1st campaign is for 3 months, I anticipate 200 posts, more or less, will be resteemed each month. <br />1st month: 150 smartcash allocation<br />2nd month: 200 smartcash allocation<br />3rd month: 250 smartcash allocation<br />Total: 600 smartcash allocation for the 1st campaign</p>\n<p><br />&gt; Smartcash SBD/Steem Exchange Rate</p>\n<p>As at Thursday 9th August, 2018<br />1 Smart = 0.058 USD<br />1 Smart = 0.053 Steem<br />1 Smart = 0.054 SBD</p>\n<p><br />&gt; **How Word About SmartCash Will Be Spread On Steemit**</p>\n<p>Strategy 1: I will spread the word on steemit about the smartcash income opportunity my resteem service provides by posting 2 to 3 times daily about it, and also i will employ the use of other popular resteem services, to get my posts seen by their own audiences and followers.</p>\n<p>Strategy 2: I run a discord server for my resteem service. I have 200 members currently in my server. Steemit users who like my resteem service and want to get more value out of it, when they join my discord server, are also introduced to more smartcash opportunities and the smartcash community on discord.</p>\n<p>&gt; **Benefits for SmartCash**</p>\n<p>Putting SMARTCASH in the hands of many steemit users using my resteem service as the point of distribution, will make many people to pick extra interest in SmartCash, and increase its adoption rate throughout the steemit platform, because the people receiving SmartCash rewards for using my resteem service, will ultimately want to cash in on the SmartCash rewards they have received. In the process, they will also come to learn about the inherent value that lies in SmartCash and begin to embrace it wholly, starting with joining the smartcash community.</p>\n<p>Promoting the \"Smartcash For Resteem\" service actively on steemit, will be creating more value for smartcash in the long run, as more people know about smartcash and its rewards through my resteem service and this will build further interest in them about smartcash</p>\n<p>&gt; **IN CONCLUSION**</p>\n<p>I beleive that if this proposal is supported and approved, all steemit users who use my resteem service will adopt SmartCash, in less than 30 days of receiving steady rewards. I predict a 100% conversion rates from non-smartcash users to full smartcash users for every steemit user receiving SmartCash rewards through my resteem service, and also many more people will become aware of smartcash as a rewarding cryptocurrency and payment coin.</p>\n<p>Your comments on this proposal will be highly appreciated, constructive or critical, it will be accepted in all fairness. Thank you!</p>",

Four events have already been held by CRIPTO SPACE and adherence has been increasing, as more people are interested in obtaining knowledge in crypto-coins, as well as networking.</p>\n<p>In October we will hold an exclusive event of SmartCash, the intention of this, is to invite people and companies to know the tools offered by the currency and its network. We understand that today is the right time to introduce SmartCash into commercial and other businesses, promote the use by individuals and encourage more and more the technology of this currency, because we want SmartCash popularly known when the crypto market reaches maturity.</p>\n<p>In this way, we set out below our objectives for the 1st big event exclusive of SmartCash in Brazil:</p>\n<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Increase the awareness of SmartCash</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this event, we will receive from entrepreneurs interested in implanting the crypts in their establishments as payment method, to people who already have SmartNodes and interested in getting to know the currency and its technology better.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>To encourage the use of currency in Brazil </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Brazil has great influence in Latin America and is well known for its vast territory and technology. This will be the first SmartCash event in Brazil and so SmartCash will benefit from a year-round presence on CRIPTO SPACE: the SmartCash logo will be associated with our events always as a project sponsor. In addition, we will regularly publish articles on currency on our website <u>criptospace.net</u>.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Increasing SmartCash network </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will demonstrate the strong presence of SmartCash in Brazil, which already has several MasterNodes, attracting more people interested in supporting the currency, through its use in SmartBands, SmartCards and we will encourage the creation of new currency nodes during the event.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>\n<p>We created the CRIPTO SPACE project in 2018, in Bras&iacute;lia - DF, capital of Brazil, to promote events related to the crypto world, share knowledge with people who wish to enter this world, join the enthusiasts of the subject and promote networking. We seek to reach the public that has heard about Bitcoin and its Altcoins, but still fear to enter this world for not really knowing the technology.</p>\n<p>Since the creation of CRIPTO SPACE we have already held four events, the first edition addressed the theme \"Decentralizing everything\" that attracted the attention of all types of audience that were present at the event, from the most lazy to the most involved in the universe of cryptomoedas, focusing on the possibilities that the decentralization can provide in the most diverse spheres, showing even that it can be part of the daily life of people.</p>\n<p>Already the second edition came with the theme \"Understanding Bitcoin\" that involved all the participants talking about the most introductory subjects related to Bitcoin to topics that are of interest to those with more advanced knowledge - for example: what is and how to do MasterNodes of some crypto-coins.</p>\n<p>The third edition was about SmartCash and the most prominent topics during the event were the SmartNodes service, Rewards, and Smart usability forms through AtarBand and SmartCard.

An entrepreneur and reputable programmer with about 7 years of experience in web and mobile development. I lead the Phalanx team which won the first angelhack(<a href=\"http://angelhack.com/angelhack-lagos\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://angelhack.com/angelhack-lagos<span class=\"badge badge-notification clicks\" title=\"2 clicks\">2</span></a>) hackathon in conjunction with Consensys in Nigeria. I have worked for Google Developers Groups and Andela programs here in Nigeria for over 3 years. I currently work as a software engineer with Farmcrowdy &ndash; Africa&rsquo;s best digital startup in Africa 2018, while also having vast experience in smart contract development, Machine learning with Firebase, Media players and live streams SDKs.</p>\n<p>I also currently lead the forloop&rsquo;s developers community in Ogun state, Nigeria, while also being part of the Blockchain community in Nigeria lead organized by reputable companies like Paxful, Seso global and uPort.</p>\n<p>I have a solid experience in managing teams and being part of product development from start to finish. You can know more about me here: Linkedin profile:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/androidmaven\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/androidmaven<span class=\"badge badge-notification clicks\" title=\"4 clicks\">4</span></a></p>\n<p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong><br />The primary reason why merchants are reluctant to accepting cryptocurrency generally is because of the volatility of cryptocurrency. A buyer could buy a good/service in a minute, pays for it using Smartcash and the next day the value of Smartcash to fiat has either high depreciation or appreciation. Merchants may lose valuable funds especially when liquidation is needed at a point when the value of Smartcash has depreciated.<br />We made a recent phone call survey of 50 merchants across Africa having clothing lines, restaurants, pizza shops, shopping malls and hair styling businesses to validate our hypothesis. 90% i.e 45 merchants out of 50 are willing to accept Smartcash, 42 merchants out of the 45 however raised the issue of volatility and how having to manually liquidate often could be strenuous and less efficient.<br />This shows that until we are able to solve the problem of crypto liquidity on behalf of the merchants, mass and genuine adoption might still be far away.<br />As of now</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<pre><code>   NO PLATFORM OFFERS POS SYSTEM AND SAFE GUARDS VOLATILITY.\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<pre><code>  OTHER BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM OFFERS JUST POS, no liquidation assistance.\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. HOW</strong></p>\n<p>In other to solve the problems highlighted above, we&rsquo;ve started working on a POS software which allows buyers in any country to pay for goods and services using Smartcash and merchants can choose either of the following<br />a. Merchants can receive Smartcash directly to their own wallet, and on that same be able to liquidate to fiat currency with just a click. A barcode will be generated which will be used to transfer the Smartcash to our address, on confirmation fiat currency will be released to the bank account provided by the merchant.<br />We will partner with exchange sites in both Nigeria and Ghana who will provide APIs for fast liquidation.<br />b. Merchants can choose to receive Smartcash directly to their own wallet at the point of sale and decides how it is being spent, liquidated or exchange at their own will. This works basically LIKE A NORMAL POS SYSTEM.</p>\n<p>Merchants can choose to liquidate all funds or store up Smartcash at the point of sale.</p>\n<p><em>It also gives database integration of all transaction taking place, so that merchants can have a log of all transactions in their own customized database starting from the fiat value and Smartcash of the good/service to be paid for, Smartcash paid, and the fiat value that was disbursed after an automated liquidation. These are useful and important to keep track of all records and for analytics purposes.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2. WHAT WE ARE BUILDING</strong></p>\n<p>We are building Smart on sale. Smart on sale is a Smartcash universal point of sale system able to safeguard merchants from volatility by providing automated liquidation. Smart on sale will be available on the web and Android.</p>\n<p>Smart on sale, is for all types of merchants. Starting from the big shopping malls to the mobile business owners. The POS system is usable by merchants in the world, while the liquidity enablement is supported for only Nigeria and Ghana at the moment.</p>\n<p><em>Merchants can simply visit or download smart on sale app, register or login the business, enter business&rsquo;s payment receiving details and start receiving payments using Smartcash. Custom integration will also be available for big companies who prefer a privatized integration of transactions database</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>THE PICTURE AND BENEFITS</strong></p>\n<div class=\"containerCozy-336-Cz container-206Blv\">\n<div class=\"markup-2BOw-j\">Merchants do not accept smartcash because they can not easily transfer to fiat -Naira/ Cedis. Our solution will make this problem go away. We expect to sign up 200 number of merchants as a result. We are currently in talks with organizers and attendees of Cheetah Africa&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cheetah-africa-launch-fintech-and-blockchain-conference-2018-tickets-47987749651\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cheetah-africa-launch-fintech-and-blockchain-conference-2018-tickets-47987749651#</a>&nbsp; and many other businesses</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>IMPACT TO SMARTCASH</strong><br />Nigeria and Ghana alone have over 200 million population and over 96% users of smartphones are on Android.&nbsp;Safeguarding volatility and liquidation for merchants in these areas can provide a massive adoption of Smartcash. The increased merchant acceptance of Smartcash will lead people worldwide or in accepted countries to buy and keep buying more of Smartcash on an exchange so that they can now purchase goods and services using Smartcash, therefore, leading to a massive appreciation in Smartcash&rsquo;s value.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPACT TO MERCHANTS AND BUSINESS</strong><br />Over 10 million merchants and businesses globally will be empowered by Smart on sale. Smart on sale respects your privacy. No personal information is required to set up an account. No government tax IDs or hocus pocus paperwork need be submitted. No photographs of you standing with signed documents. Just email, password, and a payment receiving details. It&rsquo;s really that simple.<br />Merchants can now easily receive payments using Smartcash cryptocurrency without the worry of volatility. Whether in the office, shop or public transit &ndash; Payment can be made using Smartcash while safeguarding volatility!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PREPARATION AND THINGS WE HAVE DONE BEFORE NOW!</strong></p>\n<p>1.

Give out conferences two days (2 conferences to 150 each one, 300 students reached per University) and the rest of the days SmartCash will be promoted by handing out important information (Flyers and talk Face two Face). We will interact with the students trying to involve them with the technology as much as we can.</p>\n<p>Our objective will be to invite a minimum of 30 students and kickstart a SmartCash community in each University and bring all the ideas that they have to the network as well start using SmartCash inside the University paying in the cafeteria, rent of equipment or in any idea that they have about it.</p>\n<p>As well as invite 100 devs to be part of workshops to 25 people each one, where they will be taught to set up Smartnodes and use blockchain technology, in a later event. With this effort we will evangelize at least 400 people, creating an important community of SmartCash users plus the one that already exists.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;

I am a Bachelor of Commerce graduand and a SmartCash advocate in the University of Cape Coast. Just like everyone here, I believe that SmartCash is the future and a real example of a 21<sup>st</sup> century currency because of its incentivized and decentralized nature. I also believe that students should be our target if we really want to precipitate the massive adoption and invasion of SmartCash as a generally accepted medium of exchange.</p>\n<p>My vision is to see SmartCash being adopted as a store of value and medium of exchange inside the University of Cape Coast and beyond. I seek an opportunity from community members to achieve this vision.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the primary revisions to the old proposal #507?</strong></p>\n<p>In the previous proposal we aimed at organizing five (5) different workshops at hall levels within the University to educate fresh students. In this current one we aim at organizing just one big workshop to educate our target audience. There is a significant cost reduction from $2940 to $1302 representing 55.71% reduction in the previous budget. We are going for a bigger venue this time and more work will be done on publicity so as to involve as many fresh students as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s our aim?</strong></p>\n<p>Basically, our goal is to introduce SmartCash to a new set of publics (Fresh University Students) through a workshop/seminar. If approved, this shall further increase the size of the SmartCash community and aid the massive adoption and usability of SmartCash. Just like me, many students are ready to learn and embrace any idea that will lead to financial freedom.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Execution of this project will trigger the invasion of SmartCash as a generally accepted medium of exchange and also educate students on all the benefits and merits of using SmartCash against other cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p><strong>About the University of Cape Coast</strong></p>\n<p>The University of Cape Coast (<a href=\"https://www.ucc.edu.gh/aboutus/about-ucc\">https://www.ucc.edu.gh/aboutus/about-ucc</a>) is one of the largest tertiary institutions in Ghana with an incremental annual enrollment status of about 15,650 students. The university, which is five kilometers west of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Coast\">Cape Coast</a>, is on a hill overlooking the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean\">Atlantic Ocean</a>. It operates on two campuses: the Southern Campus (Old Site) and the Northern Campus (New Site). The University is very large with geographically dispersed students.</p>\n<p>The good news is that most University students have laptops and smart phones and are actively involved in conversations on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Also, First year students reside in Halls with wireless internet connection which creates room for all-day internet connectivity. These serve as opportunities to introduce cryptocurrencies especially SmartCash to these fresh students since they have the needed devices to join the &lsquo;Smart Train&rsquo;.</p>\n<p><strong>Action Plan</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;A workshop/seminar shall be organized inside the University community to educate Students about SmartCash. The education and training outline for participants is detailed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the workshop, all participants will be given a general education on the Blockchain technology and crypto currencies. They will be lectured on SmartCash and given practical training on how to set up Smart Wallets and its features, how to send/receive SMARTS, buying/selling SMARTS on local exchanges and the merits of choosing SmartCash over other cryptocurrencies. Participants will also be educated on why they should invest in SmartCash with respect to SmartRewards and SmartHive projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Timeline for the project</strong></p>\n<p>This project shall be executed on 22<sup>nd</sup> September, 2018.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Budget:</strong></p>\n<p>Transportation&nbsp; &nbsp;$115</p>\n<p>Hiring Venue for Workshop&nbsp; $255</p>\n<p>Refreshments for all Participants&nbsp; $150</p>\n<p>SmartCash T-shirts&nbsp; &nbsp;$300</p>\n<p>Communication, Publicity, data calls&nbsp; $90</p>\n<p>Photographer/Cameraman $150</p>\n<p>Tokens for Participants in SMARTS&nbsp; &nbsp;$50</p>\n<p>Banner for Workshop&nbsp; &nbsp;$130</p>\n<p><strong>Sub-total&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>$<strong>1240</strong></p>\n<p>Contingency (5%*1240) $62</p>\n<p><strong>TOTAL</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;$<strong>1302</strong></p>\n<p>We are therefore asking for <strong>$1302 </strong>or equivalent number of <strong>SMARTS</strong> to execute this project.</p>\n<p><strong>Justification</strong></p>\n<p>We shall make every necessary reports, photos and videos available to members of this community.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The proposal aims at promoting SmartCash in Bulgaria - a country with established and thriving IT community in Eastern Europe. This nation is the homeland of some of the most talented software engineers in the world who are naturally fascinated by the emerging blockchain technology and decentralized applications. Currently, there is an exponential interest in cryptocurrencies, investment opportunities in tokens and trading platforms. The people in Bulgaria are eager to explore new ways of executing transactions based on distributed ledger technology and to re-engineer and remodel existing processes in more secure and more secure environment.</p>\n<p>The lack of transparency in public sector is a recognized problem and the financial institutions in Bulgaria charge some of the highest fees and interest rates in Europe. The citizens are looking for alternative platforms to make payments and get loans. Peer-to-peer lending services are gradually growing in terms of popularity and market adoption, laying the foundation of more disruptive fintech companies. Regularly organized crypto meetups attract more and more participants and the members of online thematic groups exploded in the last year. <br /> <br />These trends and the general enthusiasm create the demand of events presenting new blockchain products, crypto currencies and services built on top of decentralized platforms. There are prerequisites for a warm welcoming of conferences focused on these topics and this proposal sets the scene for initiatives that will increase the awareness about SmartCash and will accelerate its adoption in Europe.<br /> <br />The main goal of the project is the organization of conference called \"SmartCash and crypto future (freedom)\". The event will bring together the blockchain and crypto communities in the region and it will be held in the Bulgarian capital Sofia - where the most people interested in blockchain in the country are located. The host and lead organizer will be Startup Factory - a non-profit organization in public benefit committed to developing the entrepreneurial ecosystem and IT sector. The format of the conference is a mixture of presentations, workshops and inspirational talks. There will be panels for techies and non-techies.

Antena 3 Internacional and Discovery Networks Latin America / U.S. Hispanic are the two official television channels of the American Capital of Culture.\n\nAnzoátegui will take over from the city of Mérida (Yucatán, Mexico).\nStarting from this premise and reaffirming constant commitments with the American people, the event is an important initiative in recent years for the state, so that entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs and communities can consider the use and development of business solutions in a new economy based in the technology.\n\nIn the cultural event it promises a great scope since it will consist of conferences in the field of entrepreneurship, parade of regional designers, recreation area for children, shows of ventures in all its modalities, stage productions, live music, among others.\n\nThe event will last 11 hours, it is estimated the presence of more than 1000 people, among them, businessmen, merchants and entrepreneurs from the north of the state, from 10:00 am to 9:00 pm .\n\nWith the aforementioned, we can contact people interested in our service, especially that we will make the first approach with people from different specialties.\n\nIn our case, the SmartCash team will have five members, able to take advantage of the participation of attendees with the same interest in one place to illustrate the benefits promised by digital money today.",

a video endorsement by the smartcash community and the team -</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Aim of this proposal&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">This proposal is to create a smartcash Theme song that every smartcash fans can use on their projects or work</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">sing to and also use in recognizing smartcash everywhere or any where you go-</span></p>\n<p>A theme song we all can all be proud of, a song that inspires us about smartcash and keeps us reminded when we listen to it about the major plans and dream to **Decentralized everything**</p>\n<p>This theme song will be accompanied with a professional video that gets promoted all over different countries by different smartcash users and this could lead in creating a mass and a door to awareness for the project smart project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The aim of this proposal is simple, create a professional theme song and video, give it to the community, let everyone promotes it by writing a proposal for promoting it with any medium they think works better. once this goes beyond and far, also out of our imaginations and people all over the world start listening to this theme song,and see the importance of the smartcash currency, they will definitely get drawn and understand the details of the song, cause i would have to make it as easy as possible and a full insight that a hearer would have known 70% of smartcash, that they tend to find out more about the meaning of the remaining 30 percent.</p>\n<p><strong>what needs to be done and its</strong> <strong>benefits</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This song would be planned and written carefully and would 100% all about smartcash products in fact the song should describe and define smartcash[Just like the third song -\"what is smartcash\" but this one should be unique] that listeners won't even look like a noob once they checked on the smartcash.cc site as the song already made them imaged smartcash project musically, through them listening to its content or through the musical video of the smartcash theme song.</p>\n<p><strong>How proposal should be</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>This theme song is a very difficult but a promising project and putting haste on it isn't a good idea and i have been planing it carefully for over 6 months now.&nbsp;</em></span></p>\n<p>So I Titled The fourth song <strong>\"</strong><strong>ALL OVER THE WORLD\" .&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Its simple and goes like this</span></p>\n<p>- <strong>Create a smartcash professional audio</strong></p>\n<p><strong>- Then follow suit, shoot the professional video</strong></p>\n<p><strong>- the smartcash community promotes it on every medium (either social medias or the TV stations) by writing a proposal and gets funded by everyone who accepts their method of creating awareness for the song.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>Making sure i Dish out a quality taste with three or more proposals</strong></em></span></p>\n<p>The aim of this project is to create a</p>\n<p>- <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">universal smartcash theme song (accepted by everyone)&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">- create a professional video</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">&nbsp;- and **\"lets\"** all promote it to the world</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Those songs you listened to earlier, [my first second and third smartcash songs] are good but lacks professional production and video production. -</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>ROAD MAPS&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Since the project is a tough one and hasn't be done in the crypto space before or it is rare.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I will break each Road maps into three proposals.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This is the first proposal that you are reading which is to create a Smartcash professional theme song, after this proposal passed and i have successfully completed all milestone and delivered a unique Theme song to the community, I will be putting out another proposal for the video promotion with the same proposal title \"<strong>Smartcash Theme Song (Professional Audio And Video)&nbsp;</strong> \" and submit the audio file of this proposal after completing, so here, all smartcash voters (communities) can listen to the audio mp3 and decides if its worth to get&nbsp; the video done for community.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>if the first proposal which is the audio proposal passed, the audio will be out for everyone to listen to, and the first ever smartcash crypto song, funded by the smartcash community gets accomplished and the necessary video details and all what is needed to make the video a success will be on the second proposal, and if passed too and the video proposal completed successfully.</li>\n<li>Once the video is done,the smartcash core team announced it, Me or any member of the smartcash community, can always create a proposal to promote the smartcash theme song in their own country and local tvs/radio stations,internet also, dtube, YouTube etc)&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Meaning anyone can create a proposal to promote the Smartcash theme song on any medium of their choice they think they are capable of handling</span>, if this promotional proposal for this theme song is carried out successfully for each countries and regions by everyone that created that proposal - Creating a smart awareness becomes alot more easier than our imaginations - Imagine if smartcash Theme song becomes everyone's favorite song to sing all over the world?</p>\n<p>-Imagine if crypto users fancy that songs and took to use it on a daily, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">we call that a stress free promotion</span> as it has been accepted by everyone involved not only in the smart community but lovers of crypto projects all around, maybe because of its musical contents and presentations, What if an award is given to the song as the best ever cryptocurrency song trending world wide, what do you imagine the impacts will be, since anyone can create a proposal to promote this theme song in their own way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>- we never may know - this might make smartcash more unique than other projects and gives it a much more better value.</p>\n<p>**Time to make smartcash greater like always** ??</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PREVIOUSLY DONE SONGS FOR CRYPTO PROJECTS&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>I have done few tunes for crypto projects, like Eos blockchain steemit,steemgigs, whaleshares.io etc and have been used severally by bloggers and vloggers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>whaleshares.io is sharing platform fork out of steemit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A song i did for this crypto project is shown to every new members after successful registrations to play, as an official song and this tends to gives them a warm welcome to the platform.this shows music has a major role to play in crypto projects very soon,lets don't get left out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A link to their welcome page</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://whaleshares.io/welcome\">https://whaleshares.io/welcome</a></p>\n<p>My choon blockchain page&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[More blockchain songs will be uploaded too]&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://choon.co/tracks/0y9kzkpudzl\">https://choon.co/tracks/0y9kzkpudzl</a></p>\n<p><strong>FUNDS BREAK DOWN&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>I won't be the one composing the lyrics of the songs, \"ALL OVER THE WORLD\" cause i will have to take it to other musical gurus to take a look and for lyrics corrections if needs be, things might be added by them or subtracted just to make it unique.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I will be working with multiple producers in order to perfect this song.from voice couch to beat producers,voice recorders,Mixing and so on</span></p>\n<p>- Musical contents/couches - 620 usd</p>\n<p>- professional Beat - 200 to 250 usd</p>\n<p>- production wise - 300</p>\n<p>- mix and mastering- 400</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>SOME FAQs</strong></p>\n<p>1,ain't you a producer? why cant you produce the song and keep the funds all for your self.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ans- yes I am a producer, and have my own field of production and I take it you've listened to all songs i did on my own , they are good songs but my mini studio lacks some major items and musical instruments that makes songs looks to the taste of professionalism we need as a world wide song.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2, So smartcash community will be funding you for your contents too, how are you helping the dream and the community?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ans: i did songs for smartcash that most of you might not have heard. i did it willingly for the love of the community like most of you who know me do know how passionate i am to the project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>the contents of this song \"All over the world\" will be mine 90 percent lyrics but technically a good song isn't done by one person, they will be a lot of reviews by many producers, most would want me to pay for their time,and i have to cause i know what i want. at the end of it all, i might not have any USD left for my self as the content creator. How would you believe this?</p>\n<p>by the productivity of the song and the lyrics with efforts of gurus outside the scene, you definitely see the unique works done by me and any producers that work with me.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3} Too much cooks spoils the broth.</p>\n<p>ans- In music that's not true, the more creative and talented people involved in that musical project,the more creativeness,awesome the record looks.</p>\n<p>?&nbsp;</p>",

An entrepreneur and reputable programmer with about 7 years of experience in web and mobile development. I lead the Phalanx team which won the first angelhack hackathon in conjunction with Consensys in Nigeria. I have worked for Google Developers Groups and Andela programs here in Nigeria for over 3 years.

You can know more about me here: Linkedin profile:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/androidmaven\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/androidmaven</a></p>\n<p><strong>4. THE PROBLEM</strong><br />The primary reason why merchants are reluctant to accepting cryptocurrency generally is because of the volatility of cryptocurrency. A buyer could buy a good/service in a minute, pays for it using Smartcash and the next day the value of Smartcash to fiat changes. Merchants may lose valuable funds especially when liquidation is needed at a point when the value of Smartcash has depreciated. Majority of these merchants are not knowledgeable on how exchange sites works and having to go through that process is definitely A BIG TURN OFF as compared to them continuing accepting fiat.<br />We made a recent phone call survey of 50 merchants across Africa having clothing lines, restaurants, pizza shops, shopping malls and hair styling businesses to validate our hypothesis. 90% i.e 45 merchants out of 50 are willing to accept Smartcash, 42 merchants out of the 45 however raised the issue of volatility and how having to manually liquidate often could be strenuous and less efficient.<br />This shows that until we are able to solve the problem of crypto liquidity on behalf of the merchants, mass and genuine adoption might still be far away.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>5. EFFECT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br />Smartcash adoption for merchants in Africa will require a gradual process. An entry strategy is first as a means of payment, and then as a private bank.<br />A larger population of businesses in Africa are the SMEs i.e. small scale and medium enterprises who are not yet accustomed to cryptocurrency. For these businesses to consider a new and better alternatives of what they are used to &ndash; there is need to provide a simple, easy and fast way to accept this new currency, ensure they don&rsquo;t lose value of it due to volatility and can easily get this same equivalent of cryptocurrency to their bank account.</p>\n<p><br />Existing most widely used way of liquidation in Africa<br />(1) SMARTCASH IN WALLET &ndash;&gt; (2) SMARTCASH IN EXCHANGE SITE -&gt; (3) TRADE FOR BTC/ETH -&gt; (4) GOES TO ESCROW -&gt; LOCAL CURRENCY SENT TO BANK ACCOUNT.</p>\n<p><br />What Safemart do.<br />(1) SMARTCASH IN ANY WALLET -&gt; (2) SEND SMART TO X ADDRESS -&gt; (3) LOCAL CURRENCY SENT TO BANK ACCOUNT.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>6. SOLUTION - HOW</strong><br />To create a simple, easy platform whereby,</p>\n<pre><code>  KYC of these businesses will be made &ndash; to ensure only merchants have 24/7 access to automated and instant liquidation.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>  A smooth interface where validated merchants can input the amount of SMARTCASH they want to liquidate and the bank details.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>  A check out page having barcode and manual payment address is being instantly generated.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>  As soon as the payment is confirmed in the block, the equivalent value of SMART sent to the local currency is instantly sent to the merchant&rsquo;s given bank details.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>  A receipt of this transaction logged for users history, and a copy sent to the provided email address.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>  Support for merchants to handle enquiries and complaints should any arises.\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>7. SOLUTION &ndash; WHAT</strong><br />We are building Safemart, a simple, easy and instant automated liquidation of Smartcash to safeguard merchants in Africa from volatility. Safemart will be available on both web and android platform as standalone &ndash; and is also being built in a way which can be implemented and plugged into the SmartPay app. Safemart will be developed firstly for Nigeria and Ghana, with time be extended to other countries.</p>\n<p>With a few-clicks merchants can easily convert their Smartcash to local currency directly to their designated bank account.</p>\n<p><strong>8. PICTORIAL VIEWS OF THE SOLUTION</strong><br />Here is a short video explaining the integration of Safemart with SmartPay - This is a working UI design:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TqDRL7bMx4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TqDRL7bMx4</a></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: </em></p>\n<p><em>(1) The app represented in this video is only meant to explain how the integration with SmartPay is. It does not cover the entirety of the Safemart project for the mobile app (standalone) or web version which will be developed as soon as the voting passes.</em></p>\n<p><em>(2) As we work closely with the SmartPay developers, certain design patterns for integration with SmartPay may still be reviewed and changed.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>9. HOW IT CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO SMARTPAY (Android).</strong><br />After the app have been developed and tested working, we plan to work closely with the SmartPay developers in which SafeMart can be available as a library. After payment has been received using SmartPay or Smartcard -&gt; A button added to the SmartPay (called e.g liquidate) -&gt; Safemart library is been fired up and handles the rest of liquidation. <em>Kindly see the video above for a visual aid</em></p>\n<p><strong>10. WHY A STANDALONE VERSION IS NECESSARY</strong><br />Merchants can receive payment in diverse ways different from using SmartPay and Smartcard, it could be from a private transfer to merchants Smartcash wallet or existing Smartcash available in exchange sites. An easy way to get these funds in other wallets other received using SmartPay, is to provide a standalone website/app where they could send the SMART to, and receive local currency instantly.</p>\n<p><strong>11 HOW IT&rsquo;S DIFFERENT AND BETTER THAN ANY OTHER EXISTING LIQUIDATING PLATFORMS LIKE PAYTOMAT.</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<pre><code>  Paytomat is not built to be plugged into Smartcash&rsquo;s SmartPay application.\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<pre><code>  Target market is not optimized for S.M.Es in Africa especially in Nigeria and Ghana.\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<pre><code>  Paytomat will require you banking Smartcash using their platform to liquidate, Safemart does not store Smartcash.\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<pre><code>  Safemart provides instant liquidation for the countries supported per time, while it will take longer time for Paytomat to complete liquidation.\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<pre><code>  Safemart will include Smartcash&rsquo;s brand to its design, Paytomat does not.\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<pre><code>  Use flow of liquidation is quite different, for Safemart is so much easier and straight forward.\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Merchants do not accept smartcash because they can not easily transfer to fiat -Naira/ Cedis. Our solution will make this problem go away. We expect to sign up 100 number of merchants as a result. We are currently in talks with organizers and attendees of Cheetah Africa&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cheetah-africa-launch-fintech-and-blockchain-conference-2018-tickets-47987749651\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cheetah-africa-launch-fintech-and-blockchain-conference-2018-tickets-47987749651#<span class=\"badge badge-notification clicks\" title=\"1 click\">1</span></a>&nbsp;and many other businesses</p>\n<p><strong>12. IMPACT TO SMARTCASH COMMUNITY</strong><br />Nigeria and Ghana alone have over 200 million population and over 95% users of smartphones are on Android. Safeguarding volatility and liquidation for merchants in these areas can provide a massive adoption of Smartcash. The increased merchant acceptance of Smartcash will lead people worldwide or in accepted countries to buy and keep buying more of Smartcash on an exchange so that they can now purchase goods and services using Smartcash, therefore, leading to a massive appreciation in Smartcash&rsquo;s value.</p>\n<p><strong>13. IMPACT TO MERCHANTS AND BUSINESS IN AFRICA</strong><br />Thousands of merchants and businesses in Africa will be empowered by Safemart. Safemart respects your privacy. No government tax IDs or hocus pocus paperwork need be submitted. Merchants can now easily receive payments using Smartcash cryptocurrency without the worry of volatility.</p>\n<p><strong>14 A STEP ABOVE SMARTCASH COMPETITORS LIKE DASH AND PIVX</strong></p>\n<p>It is not a news to say there are existing major competitors like Dash and PIVX who may be closely monitoring the affairs of Smartcash. Both competitors all have their own POS systems, but None of them has grabbed hold of this technology that provides simple, easy and instant liquidation yet, due to no one raising proposals like this, lack of expertise etc. Enabling this technology will be one more step above Dash and PIVX.</p>\n<p><strong>15. WE HAVE DONE IN PREPARATION.</strong><br />1. My team and I have the technical expertise to build this, and since the inception of positive reviews on the PRE-proposal we have started working on the general components like the intro, login and signups, including mock-up for integration with SmartPay as seen in the video link above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />2. We had a meeting with the financial inclusion companies that will enable disburse the payments to local currencies for merchants like Flutterwave(<a href=\"https://flutterwave.com/\">https://flutterwave.com/</a>) and Paystack (<a href=\"https://paystack.com/\">https://paystack.com/</a>), which resulted positive.</p>\n<p><br />3. Meeting with a lawyer who will handle all legal issues.</p>\n<p><br />Building this project will require us starting from own locality where we have immediate access to merchants which is Nigeria, however, with time we will extend to other African countries and then to other continents. But we need to start first.</p>\n<p>WHAT WE NEED.<br />Community support: we need the backing of the community we want to promote.<br />Funding: Funding to proceed to make the project work.<br />Strategic bits of advice for execution.</p>\n<p><strong>16.

F.A.Q (FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>THERE IS AN EXISTING APP FOR SMARTCASH, HOW DOES THIS AFFECT THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Safemart gives an additional important functionality for the technologies like SmartPay and Smartcards buy providing instant automated liquidation. Safemart can be integrated into the existing SmartPay app.<br />NOTE: Safemart is not solving bill payments as SmartPay and Smartcard already solved that. The issue is using Smartcash and merchants being able to exchange it for fiat with reduced volatility.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>SMARTCASH TECHNOLOGIES E.G SMARTCARD POINT OF FORCE IS ZERO FEES, HOW DO YOU MANAGE FEES ABOUT CONVERSION TO FIAT AND SEND TO BANK ACCOUNT?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Firstly, Safemart project does not in any way affect the models Smartcard or any existing Smartcash technologies. It is important to note that,<br />Majority of banks in Nigeria and Ghana charges very minute transactional fees. And online payment platforms also charges minute transactional % as low as 1% per transaction. We will deduct the transactional fee (which will be visible and transparent to the merchant during checkout) from the total amount to be sent to bank account.<br />E.G if transactional fee is 1% and user&rsquo;s equivalent local currency in Naira (Nigerian currency) is&nbsp;<span class=\"hashtag\">#30</span>,000. 1% of 30,000 &ndash;&nbsp;<span class=\"hashtag\">#300</span>. Amount that will be sent to user&rsquo;s bank account will be 30,000 &ndash; 300 -&nbsp;<span class=\"hashtag\">#29</span>,700.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<pre><code> LICENCING: WILL THERE BE ANY LICENCE NEEDED ANYWHERE IN YOUR SOLUTION.\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No, software technologies that will be used for Safemart are all open sourced. Those that requires premium payment are already included in the cost breakdowns.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<pre><code> DO YOU NEED ANYTHING FROM THE DEV TEAM, IF YES WILL THE SMARTCASH GITHUB REPO SUFFICE?\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We have gone through the Smartcash dev documentations, we can work with what is available very well. However, for the implementation and integration of Safemart on SmartPay &ndash; I will need to communicate well with the Lead developer for guidance on how to integrate this feature. This requirement only comes after completion of Safemart standalone itself.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<pre><code> DOES VOTING YES FOR THIS PROJECT AFFECT THE STAKING REWARDS FOR THE EXISTING HODL STAKERS?\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No, it in no way affects stakes. The effect it can break bring is to increase adoption of Smartcash. The more the adoption, the higher increase in the price of Smartcash.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<pre><code> WHY IS HIRING OF TWO CUSTOMER SUPPORT NEEDED?\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hiring of customer is highly important, because keeping in mind that over 70% of these merchants are not well knowledgeable on crypto, it is not advisable for business men or women in Africa to begin to start accepting any crypto without providing support for them. If merchants begins to accept Smartcash in Nigeria and Ghana, they will need people they can always call and talk to when they get lost using the system. This is necessary to support Safemart so as not to lose merchants interests.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>HOW IS THIS GOING TO BRING AN INCREASE TO THE PRICE OF SMARTCASH?<br />The potential of this Safemart is massive to the price of smartcash. The level of adoption of any cryptocurrency is in two phases<br />When cryptocurrency is used as a payment and exchange of value.<br />When cryptocurrency are now being banked, which is the ultimate goal and purpose of cryptocurrency: To replace the existing banking system. For smartcash to be widely used for purpose (1) in Africa, business who will accept payment must first be supported and provided with technologies that safeguards them from volatility. As soon as that is achieved coupled with marketing, customers starts to pay for goods and services with Smartcash. The more consumers buy Smartcash as a payment method, the higher the increase of Smartcash price. Even merchants themselves will be encouraged to buy smartcash for their own banking/trading. As more consumers buy Smartcash, merchants will with time reduce the rate of liquidation as an effect of the increase of price and with time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, we ought to solve the most prominent problem for merchants first - safeguarding them volatility by providing simple, easy and instant liquidation of funds - that is what Safemart is for.</p>",

We aim at making SmartCash ubiquitous in Togo since Togo is new when it come to cryptocurrency.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION <br />Togo is one of the French speaking west African countries where cryptocurrency has not yet been introduced to . The West African Nation is home to over 7.606 million people and counted among entities where monetary mismanagement has ruined lives and wealth creation.Myself and my team have interviewed a number of small-scale businesses, businesses and market traders prior to this project and the responses revealed that most people shun banks due to a number of reasons which include lack of trust, difficulty in accessing funds, cumbersome procedures in opening accounts, and high interest charges on loans. Surprisingly, most Small and Medium Enterprises owners affirmed that they cannot trust banks with their savings due to hidden charges and unclear condition. There is no doubt the country is ready for use of cryptocurrencies to enjoy its good fruit. Amazingly SmartCash can use this as first mover advantage to capture Togo for it to become first SmartCash nation<br />Togo is divided into five regions namely centrale, Kara, Maritime, Plateau and savenes with Lome been the capital city which is located in Maritime. Togo shared borders with Ghana where cryptocurrency is gradually gaining root a lot of economics activities goes on between Ghana and Togo introducing smartcash in Togo can really help economic activities to boom since receiving remittances and money can be made easily focusing on instant aspect of SmartCash and it border free feature. Recently there was agreement between Togo,Ghana and Burkina Faso to foster free movement of goods and services ( link to confirm the agreement <a href=\"http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/news/1257-ghana-togo-burkina-faso\">http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/news/1257-ghana-togo-burkina-faso</a> sign-pact ) here is the case individual have to change cedis to Cefa and vice versa before transaction can be made. With SmartCash, transaction will be easy and simple. Conferences will be held in the various capital cities in Togo. Two conference in each city. With a contineous meetup in each city to raise ambassadors, with &nbsp;businesses and business owners visitation to let them accept SmartCash as a form of payment. However the introduction of SmartCash to businesses and exchanges establishment will start from Maritime region the industrial and most populous region of the country for as to see how the people and businesses embrace it before we will extend to other regions of the country. <img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jxrPFYGYPR9pQcCTCoGtZAghFJ7dwNNqaekyyrSAUhLuI3OnG67jp60VNBNQC2f7hXZigo9nRE46BQt-WcM2tHgeY-QV2DLvAl9GT4PTni-TX0KLBuLnou0SgxxAbKpYrsQzlnLk\" width=\"170\" height=\"183\" /><br /><br />Why Smartcash in Togo can contribute to massive adoption<br />1. Togo is virgin when it come to cryptocurrency so SmartCash can used first mover advantage to capture the people of Togo when its &nbsp;come to cryptocurrency.<br /><br />2. The adoption of cryptocurrency in French speaking countries is very minimal as compared to countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and &nbsp;other Africa countries which are English speaking countries. However the interaction, trade and culture of the French west African countries are the &nbsp;same this means adoption for one means it will diffuse to other countries since SmartCash offers great potential to our activities and daily lives.<br /><br />3.Togo is a country in West Africa bordered by Ghana to the west, Benin to the east and Burkina Faso to the north. It extends south to the Gulf of Guinea, on which the capital Lom&eacute; is located. Togo covers an area of approximately 57,000 square kilometres. Ghana is growing very well when it come to cryptocurrency. There is a lot of economic activities that goes on between Ghana and Togo. Here is the case you have to change your Togolese currency to Ghana currency and vice versa this comes with hidden charges which are very high. With this I believed that if &nbsp;SmartCash gain root in Togo like Ghana people will start using SmartCash due to the instant and border free nature of SmartCash with that economic activities between Ghana and Togo will be smooth and convenient which will eventually make SmartCash a cryptocurrency with utility and real usage since all transactions will be made in SmartCash.<br /><br />How we will do it</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1.Merchant oriented meet up<br />There will be one on one meet up with businesses and business owners on the need to accept SmartCash as a medium of exchange showing them the great benefit smartcash offer them so as to make SmartCash a medium of exchange to increase utility and volume in circulation in Togo. Businesses who agreed to accept smartCash as medium of exchange will be listed on SmartCash &nbsp;merchant directory <a href=\"http://fine.smartcash.com/\">fine.smartcash.com</a> These meeting/meet up will create a stronger bond for SmartCash merchant, traders, exchanges and improve customer experience when participating in the SmartCash ecosystem. <br /><br />2. There will be two radio discussion and one TV discussion in each region about SmartCash to create awareness for easy mass adoption in Togo.<br /><br />3. Two conferences will be held in the various cities of each region. The conference is to create wallets, educate teach, talk and present SmartCash to the people of Togo. Under this conference participants will be thought how to download and make transactions with smartcash wallet. Benefit of using it as a medium of exchange will be our focus that is more of our teaching will be centred there since SmartCash solve most of our &nbsp;Fiat issues again an intensive education on SmartCash, how to set up SmartCash nodes , how to accept SmartCash as payment using designed printed SmartCash POS in a form of printed SmartCash QR codes or using SmartCard in future, the benefits and advantage of smart rewards and how SmartCash can be of great benefit to their businesses will be explain very well <br />All participants will be trained on the &nbsp;how to download and setup SmartCash wallets, key features of SmartCash, how to purchase SmartCash from local and international exchanges, and the advantages of using SmartCash for their daily transactions worldwide for the payment of goods and services, payment of fees/bills, receiving remittances and many more. Some dollars worth of SmartCash will be given to the participants and have them send some of it back &nbsp;to other participants. This will make them feel the speed and convenience with SmartCash and also give them experience in using SmartCash immediately. The unbanked or the under banked will therefore be encouraged to use their savings to purchase SmartCash to accumulate capital and wealth using SmartCash as store of capital in the long term to liberate themselve from their economic woes and make their entrepreneurial dream achievable.<br /><br />4.PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS<br />We will partner with organizations who share the same ideology with us and speak at their events. We will do presentations to the audience<br />and members and have an inquiry desk at the event were people could come for more information. We aim at partnering organizations which cut across boundaries so as to get opportunity to introduce SmartCash to other French west African countries.we are currently speaking to workaway to speak under their events. <a href=\"https://www.workaway.info/661342793354-en.html\">https://www.workaway.info/661342793354-en.html</a> we currently also speaking <a href=\"http://www.icye.org/icye-in-the-world/togo/\">http://www.icye.org/icye-in-the-world/togo/</a> to also give as the opportunity to partner with them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5. Participants of the conference &nbsp;who show great skills and great attitude towards our various presentation will be call out and further trained as ambassadors of smartcash who will expand &nbsp;the smartcash outreach to other part of the country and beyond.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Goals</p>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Create awareness in Togo about &nbsp;cryptocurrency (SmartCash exclusive) &nbsp;and other French west African countries through our partnership program.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Create 1000 wallet in every region we found ourselves in. Even though 1000 is our target striving to get over is also our ambition.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To onboard businesses and list them on SmartCash merchant directory and established both online and physical exchanges.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Recruit ambassadors for SmartCash who will carry on the activities. That is train, educate, teach, advice and led them work either part time or full time to spread SmartCash all over the country and across borders.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br />Justification<br />Website for <a href=\"http://smartcashafrica.org/\">smartcashafrica.org</a> will be used so well that all our activities will be post there.<br />Videos, pictures and all necessary information concerning our activities will be communicated to all smarties on the various platforms of smartcash.<br />We will also submit a text and video report documenting everything we did with lesson learned so that other teams can replicate our innovative ideas experiment in accelerating the growth of SmartCash<br /><br />Schedule<br /> This project will be executed for three month. Starting with maritime region Lome (Lom&eacute;, with a population of 837,437 metro population 1,570,283), is the capital and largest city of Togo. Located on the Gulf of Guinea, Lom&eacute; is the country's administrative and industrial center and its chief port. The city exports coffee, cocoa, copra, and palm kernels.

When demand of SmartCash begin to grow is obvious that they will be looking for exchanges that allow simple payment with mobile money and local bank accounts. With this we have decided to speak to <a href=\"http://ebitcoinic.com/\">ebitcoinic.com</a> online exchange platform in Ghana to add Togo to their platform so that people of Togo can purchase SmartCash easily and conveniently whilst we work constantly to established online exchange for all French speaking countries in Africa.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion<br />The objective of this proposal is to introduce smartcash to the people of Togo and also make SmartCash a &nbsp;&ldquo;cryptocurrency with high utility&rdquo; than speculative asset&rdquo; in Togo. When the conferences are completed business on boarded and awareness created<br />benefits will be obvious and demand will grow. People of Togo will start to <br />demand smartcash for their transactions as it solves many problems &nbsp;their<br />national currency (including portability, security, and inflation) impose on them . We<br />will make smartcash ubiquitous in Togo with high utility and velocity - with its<br />greater security, medium-of-exchange and store-of-value properties than legacy<br />currencies or fiat.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br />BUDGET<br />transportation to and within each region for a month &nbsp; &nbsp;$900.00<br />Accommodation for a month 3 people &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1000.00 &nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Smartcash T-shirts for participants in a region &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $900<br />Conference room for two conferences in a region &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1200<br />Refreshment for participants in a region &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$950<br />Two SmartCash radio discussion &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1000.00<br />One TV discussion in a region &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$600.00<br />Roll up banner &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$150.00<br />Smartcash stickers and fliers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$250.00<br />Cost of photograph services &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$500.00<br />Tokens for participants a month &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$300.00<br />Salary of &nbsp;team 300*3 for a month &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$900.00<br /> subtotal &nbsp; $8,650</p>\n<p>Total for three month 8650*3 = $25,950 &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />End notes.

            "description": "<p>The Ben Swann sponsorship has been under a heavy debate since it was created and it's finally time to vote about it's future.</p>\n<p>My first point to discuss is the state of the video and impact made so far.<br />It's currently 2018 and youtube views/likes are easily bought. (Example:https://devumi.com/youtube-views/)<br />Me and a lot others strongly question the legitimacy of the views/likes on the promotion video. <br />During Ben Swann's <strong>Dash sponsorship</strong> the spotlight videos got less than <strong>2000</strong> views, ranged between <strong>140-200</strong> likes and had between <strong>45-85</strong> comments.<br />This was during a sponsorship of a larger and widespread cryptocurrency.<br />The <strong>SmartCash spotlight video</strong> has <strong>140.000</strong> views, <strong>460</strong> likes and <strong>74</strong> comments. https://gyazo.com/964eab3e08229fe70bef136d19ef73b6<br />A different random video of his has <strong>228.000</strong> views, <strong>1100</strong> likes and <strong>273</strong> comments. https://gyazo.com/7bc101a8f603af80383bcf2d28dc97a0<br />There is an obvious conclusion to be drawn from this. Compare the likes/comments to views on the Dash spotlight and to the SmartCash spotlight.<br />Another point is that there infact was a handful of people that joined the discord influenced by the spotlight video, but that number is much lower than what 140.000 <strong><em>\"real\"</em></strong> views would have provided.</p>\n<p><br />During previous SmartCash proposals some of them have passed voting but been cancelled by the devs due to reasons such as \"being overpriced\" or funding was stopped because of milestones not being reached or fully correct, this has been the case here aswell. <br />It's on these ground I make this proposal since I deem the sponsorship overpriced and not delivering what was promised.</p>\n<p>In Ben's proposal he was claiming: \"At our current average of <strong>600,000</strong> views per video, we project over 26 million SmartCash branded views of Reality Check.\" https://gyazo.com/c0dfbef3e994977f393dc4a5f18bd004</p>\n<p>This is clearly an overstatement and not factual, nor delivered.</p>\n<p>The SmartCash communities opinion about the valuation of the sponsorship will be shown by this vote and if it passes I propose immediate cancellation of the sponsorship.</p>\n<p><br />Benefits to SmartCash - The state of SmartCash has in the market is honestly speaking in a dire state. <br />The benefit this proposal provides is avoiding <strong>12.6</strong> MILLION SmartCash (at current $ rates) of sell-pressure.</p>\n<p>It's no a secret that SmartCash proposal payments are pegged to $ and during this dump, the payments involve even more SmartCash than what was shown during the proposal.<br />As of now, Ben Swann receives over <strong>1.6</strong> million SmartCash each month (<strong>$59,334.00</strong>). <br />Ben has no incentive to hold since the proposal is pegged to $. <br />He will receive more SmartCash next month even if the price goes down. <br />That's a vicious spriral making Ben sell without any repercussions. This creates even more pressure on the market which is already negatively affected by the \"early adopter\" hack of 9 million coins.</p>\n<p>Ben's first payout: https://insight.smartcash.cc/address/SUx2yZRF9ucSGxUXT3P2QeKL797sydcUes<br />It shows it was sent shortly after being received.</p>\n<p>The recipient is linked to the hot wallet of HitBTC, showing that the payment was quickly sold off. <br />https://insight.smartcash.cc/address/SVJTaaMWkSJ4jE57GaA1pQR7Zd8e97sShg</p>\n<p>This cycle will not be exclusively affecting the market, since the cycle can be predicted and people will try to beat Ben by selling their SmartCash before him and buying them back much much cheaper.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the SmartCash discord, JuicyG (Coordinator of Outreach 1) said he spoke to Ben before the vote and claimed that Ben wants to be a holder and won't sell all the coins.&nbsp;&nbsp;https://gyazo.com/2609f9399f7dcb1cf92bed0a35bac829<br />As proven above that is not the case.</p>\n<p>The cost of this proposal is 100 SmartCash to cover the proposal cost and time of writing this.</p>",

            "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Preamble</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am skin-crypto on discord. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts, a graduate, photographer and public speaker. For the past 4 months that I joined the boat of SmartCash. I realized the need for SmartCash to be broadcast and spread in the whole of Togo and other French west countries &nbsp;to liberate as from our economic woes which fiat always impose on us. My full name is Enyadema Gilbert Klutse.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">DESCRIPTION <br />Togo is one of the French speaking west African countries where cryptocurrency has not yet been introduced to . The West African Nation is home to over 7.606 million people and counted among entities where monetary mismanagement has ruined lives and wealth creation.Myself and my team have interviewed a number of small-scale businesses, businesses and market traders prior to this project and the responses revealed that most people shun banks due to a number of reasons which include lack of trust, difficulty in accessing funds, cumbersome procedures in opening accounts, and high interest charges on loans. Surprisingly, most Small and Medium Enterprises owners affirmed that they cannot trust banks with their savings due to hidden charges and unclear condition. There is no doubt the country is ready for use of cryptocurrencies to enjoy its good fruit. Amazingly SmartCash can use this as first mover advantage to capture Togo for it to become first SmartCash nation<br />Togo is divided into five regions namely centrale, Kara, Maritime, Plateau and savenes with Lome been the capital city which is located in Maritime. Togo shared borders with Ghana where cryptocurrency is gradually gaining root a lot of economics activities goes on between Ghana and Togo introducing smartcash in Togo can really help economic activities to boom since receiving remittances and money can be made easily focusing on instant aspect of SmartCash and it border free feature. Recently there was agreement between Togo,Ghana and Burkina Faso to foster free movement of goods and services ( link to confirm the agreement <a href=\"http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/news/1257-ghana-togo-burkina-faso\">http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/news/1257-ghana-togo-burkina-faso</a> sign-pact ) here is the case individual have to change cedis to Cefa and vice versa before transaction can be made. With SmartCash, transaction will be easy and simple. Conferences will be held in the various capital cities in Togo. Two conference in each city. With a contineous meetup in each city to raise ambassadors, with &nbsp;businesses and business owners visitation to let them accept SmartCash as a form of payment. However the introduction of SmartCash to businesses and exchanges establishment will start from Maritime region the industrial and most populous region of the country for as to see how the people and businesses embrace it before we will extend to other regions of the country. <img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jxrPFYGYPR9pQcCTCoGtZAghFJ7dwNNqaekyyrSAUhLuI3OnG67jp60VNBNQC2f7hXZigo9nRE46BQt-WcM2tHgeY-QV2DLvAl9GT4PTni-TX0KLBuLnou0SgxxAbKpYrsQzlnLk\" width=\"170\" height=\"183\" /><br /><br />Why Smartcash in Togo can contribute to massive adoption<br />1. Togo is virgin when it come to cryptocurrency so SmartCash can used first mover advantage to capture the people of Togo when its &nbsp;come to cryptocurrency.<br /><br />2. The adoption of cryptocurrency in French speaking countries is very minimal as compared to countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and &nbsp;other Africa countries which are English speaking countries. However the interaction, trade and culture of the French west African countries are the &nbsp;same this means adoption for one means it will diffuse to other countries since SmartCash offers great potential to our activities and daily lives.<br /><br />3.Togo is a country in West Africa bordered by Ghana to the west, Benin to the east and Burkina Faso to the north. It extends south to the Gulf of Guinea, on which the capital Lom&eacute; is located. Togo covers an area of approximately 57,000 square kilometres. Ghana is growing very well when it come to cryptocurrency. There is a lot of economic activities that goes on between Ghana and Togo. Here is the case you have to change your Togolese currency to Ghana currency and vice versa this comes with hidden charges which are very high. With this I believed that if &nbsp;SmartCash gain root in Togo like Ghana people will start using SmartCash due to the instant and border free nature of SmartCash with that economic activities between Ghana and Togo will be smooth and convenient which will eventually make SmartCash a cryptocurrency with utility and real usage since all transactions will be made in SmartCash.<br /><br />How we will do it</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1.Merchant oriented meet up<br />There will be one on one meet up with businesses and business owners on the need to accept SmartCash as a medium of exchange showing them the great benefit smartcash offer them so as to make SmartCash a medium of exchange to increase utility and volume in circulation in Togo. Businesses who agreed to accept smartCash as medium of exchange will be listed on SmartCash &nbsp;merchant directory <a href=\"http://fine.smartcash.com/\">fine.smartcash.com</a> These meeting/meet up will create a stronger bond for SmartCash merchant, traders, exchanges and improve customer experience when participating in the SmartCash ecosystem. <br /><br />2. There will be two radio discussion and one TV discussion in each region about SmartCash to create awareness for easy mass adoption in Togo.<br /><br />3. Two conferences will be held in the various cities of each region. The conference is to create wallets, educate teach, talk and present SmartCash to the people of Togo. Under this conference participants will be thought how to download and make transactions with smartcash wallet. Benefit of using it as a medium of exchange will be our focus that is more of our teaching will be centred there since SmartCash solve most of our &nbsp;Fiat issues again an intensive education on SmartCash, how to set up SmartCash nodes , how to accept SmartCash as payment using designed printed SmartCash POS in a form of printed SmartCash QR codes or using SmartCard in future, the benefits and advantage of smart rewards and how SmartCash can be of great benefit to their businesses will be explain very well <br />All participants will be trained on the &nbsp;how to download and setup SmartCash wallets, key features of SmartCash, how to purchase SmartCash from local and international exchanges, and the advantages of using SmartCash for their daily transactions worldwide for the payment of goods and services, payment of fees/bills, receiving remittances and many more. Some dollars worth of SmartCash will be given to the participants and have them send some of it back &nbsp;to other participants. This will make them feel the speed and convenience with SmartCash and also give them experience in using SmartCash immediately. The unbanked or the under banked will therefore be encouraged to use their savings to purchase SmartCash to accumulate capital and wealth using SmartCash as store of capital in the long term to liberate themselve from their economic woes and make their entrepreneurial dream achievable.<br /><br />4.PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS<br />We will partner with organizations who share the same ideology with us and speak at their events. We will do presentations to the audience<br />and members and have an inquiry desk at the event were people could come for more information. We aim at partnering organizations which cut across boundaries so as to get opportunity to introduce SmartCash to other French west African countries.we are currently speaking to workaway to speak under their events. <a href=\"https://www.workaway.info/661342793354-en.html\">https://www.workaway.info/661342793354-en.html</a> we currently also speaking <a href=\"http://www.icye.org/icye-in-the-world/togo/\">http://www.icye.org/icye-in-the-world/togo/</a> to also give as the opportunity to partner with them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5. Participants of the conference &nbsp;who show great skills and great attitude towards our various presentation will be call out and further trained as ambassadors of smartcash who will expand &nbsp;the smartcash outreach to other part of the country and beyond.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Goals</p>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Create awareness in Togo about &nbsp;cryptocurrency (SmartCash exclusive) &nbsp;and other French west African countries through our partnership program.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Create 1000 wallet in every region we found ourselves in. Even though 1000 is our target striving to get over is also our ambition.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To onboard businesses and list them on SmartCash merchant directory and established both online and physical exchanges.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Recruit ambassadors for SmartCash who will carry on the activities. That is train, educate, teach, advice and led them work either part time or full time to spread SmartCash all over the country and across borders.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br />Justification<br />Website for <a href=\"http://smartcashafrica.org/\">smartcashafrica.org</a> will be used so well that all our activities will be post there.<br />Videos, pictures and all necessary information concerning our activities will be communicated to all smarties on the various platforms of smartcash.<br />We will also submit a text and video report documenting everything we did with lesson learned so that other teams can replicate our innovative ideas experiment in accelerating the growth of SmartCash<br /><br />Schedule<br />This project will be executed for three month. Starting with maritime region Lome (Lom&eacute;, with a population of 837,437 metro population 1,570,283), is the capital and largest city of Togo. Located on the Gulf of Guinea, Lom&eacute; is the country's administrative and industrial center and its chief port. The city exports coffee, cocoa, copra, and palm kernels. It also has an oil refinery).For &nbsp;the first 1st month and then followed by the conferences and meetup in other two regions for the last two months<br /><br />We are asking for $8,650 every month for the next three months to promote SmartCash in three regions of Togo.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Challenges</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lack of online and physical exchanges in Togo. When demand of SmartCash begin to grow is obvious that they will be looking for exchanges that allow simple payment with mobile money and local bank accounts. With this we have decided to speak to <a href=\"http://ebitcoinic.com/\">ebitcoinic.com</a> online exchange platform in Ghana to add Togo to their platform so that people of Togo can purchase SmartCash easily and conveniently whilst we work constantly to established online exchange for all French speaking countries in Africa.</p>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Team members</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Enyadema Gabriel Klutse</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">On discord as @skincrypto</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Cryptocurrency enthusiasts graduate from university of Lome (Team leader)</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Ghassinbe Faure&nbsp;</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">diploma in communication skills, graduate from University of Lome and a&nbsp; cryptocurrency enthusiasts( team member)</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Natchaba Kofi Seyi</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Graphic designer and also have diploma in marketing (team member)</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Note: The SmartCash Togo team is ready to do SmartCash full-time</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion<br />The objective of this proposal is to introduce smartcash to the people of Togo and also make SmartCash a &nbsp;&ldquo;cryptocurrency with high utility&rdquo; than speculative asset&rdquo; in Togo. When the conferences are completed business on boarded and awareness created<br />benefits will be obvious and demand will grow. People of Togo will start to <br />demand smartcash for their transactions as it solves many problems &nbsp;their<br />national currency (including portability, security, and inflation) impose on them . We<br />will make smartcash ubiquitous in Togo with high utility and velocity - with its<br />greater security, medium-of-exchange and store-of-value properties than legacy<br />currencies or fiat.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br />BUDGET<br />transportation to and within each region for a month &nbsp; &nbsp;$900.00<br />Accommodation for a month 3 people &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1000.00 &nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Smartcash T-shirts for participants in a region &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $900<br />Conference room for two conferences in a region &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1200<br />Refreshment for participants in a region &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$950<br />Two SmartCash radio discussion &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1000.00<br />One TV discussion in a region &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$600.00<br />Roll up banner &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$150.00<br />Smartcash stickers and fliers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$250.00<br />Cost of photograph services &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$500.00<br />Tokens for participants a month &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$300.00<br />Salary of &nbsp;team 300*3 for a month &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$900.00<br />subtotal &nbsp; $8,650</p>\n<p>Total for three month 8650*3 = $25,950 &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />End notes.

And at the same time encouraging the adoption in more stores showing the facilities of SmartCash to customers, they will be offered the purchase of 70$ in products to all customers that day that attend the trade.</p>\n<p>The day that SmartCashLara decides to take action in the stores will be discussed in advance to promote the event, via social networks of SmartCashLara and the merchant in question in order to ensure a high influx of customers.</p>\n<p>The day we will make a presence will be responsible for teaching people to attend what is SmartCash and how they can use it to pay for goods and services, we will teach them to transfer via wallet to wallet, by mail, through SMS, how to create the smartcard and how to load it with funds, the different Exchange where you can acquire SmartCash and how to acquire SmartCash with bolivares (currency of Venezuela).<br />In addition, we will provide support to businesses to assist them in installing the SmartCard Business and employees to use SmartPay as receive tips by SmartPay.</p>\n<p>At the end of our visit we will leave in the merchant a number of information brochures where step by step will be explained how to acquire SmartCash, how to create the wallet, how to use it, how to create the SmartCard and other points mentioned above, so that in this way the future customers who visit the stores can learn to buy and make payments with the currency and serve as a form of advertising.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Why will we do it this way?</h2>\n<p>Although entrepreneurial fairs, conferences, meetup and forums are necessary to promote SmartCash, we have been able to show that a more effective way, although with greater work, is personal and dedicated to the merchant itself.</p>\n<p>The culture of cryptocurrency, although it is booming in Venezuela, is difficult for most people, so dedicating exclusive time to each location to advise and serve as support is the best way to increase adoption.</p>\n<h2>What do we need?</h2>\n<h3>Shirts:</h3>\n<p>They will be used as uniforms, in order to create a sense of institutional support that will create confidence to the businesses and clients when we introduce ourselves and teach how to use SmartCash to pay for goods and services.</p>\n<h3>Merchant:</h3>\n<p>Amount that will be delivered to customers present the day we organize the presentation so that it is used exclusively to buy in the store. In this way, the trade will be easily incentivized to accept SmartCash because it will benefit in the short term.</p>\n<h3>Information brochures:</h3>\n<p>Brochures that will explain in detail how to buy SmartCash, the different Exchanges where it is listed, how to buy SmartCash with bolivars, how to create the wallet, how to create the SmartCard, how to send SmartCash with SMS and email and also It will serve as advertising for SmartCash.</p>\n<h3>Decals:</h3>\n<p>SmartCash stickers and the SmartCash logo are distributed to the stores so that people who attend know that they can pay with SmartCash and stickers to give to customers as a souvenir and that support SmartCash.</p>\n<h3>Transportation:</h3>\n<p>Payment for the transport of the equipment to go to the different shops being necessary due to the transport of delicate and high-value items.</p>\n<h3>SmartCard:</h3>\n<p>PVC printing of the SmartCard for SmartCashLara members to show customers how to use it and thus see how SmartCash can replace common debit cards.</p>\n<h3>Administrative Services:</h3>\n<p>Payment for the SmartCash team for the work done during four months. We will strive even more so that in the largest amount of commerce accept SmartCash as payment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Joint proposal:</h2>\n<p>This idea of adoption comes from me, a member of the SmartCashLara community and Anthony Montecalvo&nbsp;<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.smartcash.cc/u/amontecal1\">@amontecal1</a>&nbsp;member of the SmartCash Carabobo community.</p>\n<p>Which means that this initiative will be applied in both Lara and Carabobo at the same time. In order to recover the national SmartCash Venezuela community.</p>\n<p>Both communities will be dedicated to adding more and more businesses to the SmartCash cause for the mutual benefit of our cryptocurrency and the citizens of Venezuela!</p>\n<p>Here the link to the proposal of the other community.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.smartcash.cc/t/adoption-of-smartcash-in-32-potential-stores-in-valencia-venezuela/5093\">Adoption of SmartCash in 32 potential stores in Valencia - Venezuela</a></p>\n<p>We leave the idea of this project free so that anyone who wants it can imitate what we hope to achieve and in this way increase the adoption of businesses in Venezuela.</p>\n<p>Please ask them to share their doubts and help us with any kind of suggestion to carry out our project!</p>\n<h2>Required budget</h2>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://forum.smartcash.cc/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e8e76990ba016688976161075f194a29f2b06b64_1_690x196.png\" alt=\"Budget\" width=\"690\" height=\"196\" /></div>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\">\n<p>The budget will be divided into the following amounts:</p>\n<h3>First month:</h3>\n<p>For purchase of items ordered and preparation 1520$</p>\n<h3>Second month:</h3>\n<p>To encourage merchants and team salaries 1160$</p>\n<h3>Third month:</h3>\n<p>To encourage merchants and team salaries 1160$</p>\n<h3>Fourth month:</h3>\n<p>To encourage merchants and team salaries 1160$</p>\n<p>The estimated time of this proposal is four months.

Also a developtment Environment is need, of course. This means: Display, Keyboard, and so on.

            "summary": "I am the founder and CEO of Golix. At Golix, we are committed to being the leading cryptocurrency exchange in Africa and we have achieved a lot in our short history.\nWe have operations in 7 African countries, namely, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya, Cameroon and South Africa. We allow cryptocurrency to fiat conversions in those 7 countries that operate in and in terms of geographic reach and presence, Golix is Africa’s leading cryptocurrency exchange.\nGolix was born out of the frustration from an inability to make online and/or cross-border payments. The cryptocurrency exchange therefore exists to give every person in Africa Financial Autonomy which aligns well with Smartcash values of community, growth and inclusion.",
            "description": "<p>The compensation that Golix seeks will primarily be used to pay for the man hours required for full wallet integration. Most of our development team is based in Zimbabwe and South Africa but we employ the best people we can find on the continent who come from the leading companies in Africa. We therefore pay competitive salaries. Because we have top talent, we are confident we can make a significant enhancement on the UX for someone looking to buy and/or use Smartcash in any of the current markets we operate in as well as the future markets we are going to grow to.</p>\n<p>The man hour cost of the integration is significantly higher than what we are asking for - we are going to cover the bulk of the cost ourselves because we really like Smartcash. But we think it will be really awesome if we can get some support from this community.<br />We have designed our hot and cold storage wallets to provide the highest level of security for all the 7 cryptocurrency projects we have listed today and this proposal outlines a patch of buildup and integration for Smartcash support within Golix&rsquo;s expensive production offering.</p>\n<p>Integrating with Golix will make it substantially easier for for anyone in any one of the seven countries that we operate in to buy and/or sell cryptocurrency with the local fiat. Our platform has processed over US $8 millon in cryptocurrency transactions to date and our throughout our existence (we have been live since September 2015) our volume has doubled every 3 months. We now also have more than 60 thousand customers (and we're growing). We have also been fortunate to get a number of press mentions in almost all of the major publications over the years.

Those officials from the SmartCash team, tutorials, short news, market trends, main discussions on Discord or Telegram, interviews and videos on Youtube, and what&rsquo;s also very important, proposals open to the vote. Once I get the news I translate it and integrate it with in-depth analysis after creating a small graphic banner (not a professional level, I&rsquo;m not a graphic).</p>\n<p>My plan is to write in Italian at least 25 posts per month between news, official articles, market trends, translations of SmartHive proposals and analysis of YouTube videos to share on my Steemit, Minds, Gab, Twitter, Telegram and Discord channels</p>\n<p>My main goal is to increase the base of SmartCash in Italy and I am convinced that this work of mine can concretely help the circulation of information for Italians who, besides having a second source of information (after the English one) will also have articles with in-depth information on news and further support on Telegram thanks to the ever-increasing number of users.</p>\n<p>My overall demand is 260 USD/month, I know that might sound like a lot, but most of the translated articles will require nearly two hours for preparation, especially those relating to the proposals or extrapolations of interviews or statements from Youtube videos.</p>\n<p>My work can be viewed on my Steemit channel and I am sure that the quality of future content will always be growing because of the longer available time I can have in the months to follow.</p>\n<p>The total monthly request will, therefore, 260$ for the publication of at least 25 articles for a period of three months that I hope to extend at the deadline with another proposal.</p>\n<p>I would like to inform you that these&nbsp; will be reinvested in Smartnodes and that as soon as they are active their address will be made public.</p>",

With the expertise of our team, Academia Blockchain would communicate about SmartCash through four content formats:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>One in-depth technological analysis (video):</em> Our blockchain expert, Alejandro Veintimilla,&nbsp;will research and prepare his analysis before recording the video. He will explain what is SmartCash, how it operates, and what it stands for. He will also provide his insights in a simple and attractive manner&nbsp;to reach a broad audience.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em><em>One interview to a SmartCash representative (video): </em></em>The interviewer will also prepare himself about the SmartCash basics. However, the interview will have a story-telling approach, since it is targeted to new and potential users. Basically, the idea&nbsp;is to talk about the story behind the project, how it began, and how people can buy SmartCash or get involved in its community.</li>\n<li><em>Three price-oriented technical-analysis commentaries on SmartCash:&nbsp;</em>Academia Blockchain offers weekly technical-analysis commentaries on three or four cryptocurrencies.

The time for the course would be three hours in three days for a total of nine hours.</p>\n<p><br />This is made with the objetive to give support to what was learned the day before, also with the chance to get products through criptocurrency.</p>\n<p><br />The objective of the face-to-face course is promote the use of criptocurrencies with a practical base, that the community have the clarity of how Works the digital economy by knowing the blockchain, demostrate that there is transparency in the technology. Face the ignorance from knowledge of the criptocurrencies promoting interest.</p>\n<p>Why do this? I&rsquo;m a firm believer that the digital economy is here to stay and the future is the decentralized economy, I have seen some people sharing their proposals and execute them in a magnify way, however I would like to participate more actively in Smartcash supporting to the community to comprehend what really will be the future and that we can use it now for the Exchange of products, services in a more efficient and effective way.</p>\n<p>We believe that because of the rising ammount of scams focused in criptocurrencies, it is important to make the conference face-to-face, to be able to inspire to the community to invest in the digital market like is Smartcash.</p>\n<p>The idea</p>\n<p>Make a meeting with people that have local business and common people with the interest to know about the beginnings of the digital economy, the difference between digital money and common money. In the meetings the subjects will be how start the Bitcoin, how Works the blockchain, and how have evolved the criptocurrencies, how economies from different countries have already adopt the digital economy as a massive payment method. A clear example would be Venezuela.</p>\n<p>Like first proposal we&rsquo;ll have the training of the community in a clear way to continue to the second proposal of a Kermes (a Little market), where the community will be invited to participate actively in the buy and sell of products through Smartcash, using in a real way the criptocurrency, encouraging the adoption of criptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>Market Segment</p>\n<p>People with interest in the digital market changing from fiat money to criptocurrency.<br />People between 18 and 50 years what wish to learn about blockchain technology and their ample range of applications.</p>\n<p>Pre-proposal</p>\n<p>Course of digital economy based on Smartcash (History and comprehension) face-to-face</p>\n<p>Amount: $6, 600 us<br />Time: 1 month<br />Total hours to complete Project: 24 hours</p>\n<p>Objective: Educate in a clear way through a face-to-face course to the community about digital economy, with course with 20 to 25 people, 3 days at week por month promoting the use, management and adoption of Smartcash, in a total of 4 courses face-to-face, where the assistants at being in a clearer context about smartcash, will make easier to viralize the information in a more effective way.</p>\n<p>Who am I?</p>\n<p>My name is Daniel Francisco Burgos Gongora, I am a technician in computer systems, I&rsquo;m a entrepeneur, I have a pizza shop and a bakery called &ldquo;Ki Nohoch Pizza&rdquo;, it is in Colony &ldquo;Valle verde&rdquo; in the highway Cancun-Merida, I&rsquo;m a fanatic of digital economy, I like to share my knowledge about criptocurrencies with family, Friends and people, I would like to participate more in the Smartcash community by making these courses where it can be learned in a easy and clear way how criptocurrency Works.<br />I have imparted courses face-to-face about finantial education in the &aacute;rea of diversified investments, and courses where I share the evolution about Digital Currency and how to use leverage from the digital currency like an investment option. I also participate in the Smartcash community from Cancun managed by oucan and eiky, I went to international events like Talent Land in April on the city of Guadalajara, Mexico where we provided

Description of the Project:</p>\n<p>Manual of introduction to the Digital economy, evolution, management of buy and sell of products on the course that allows to be bought with Smartcash to know the way to receive and send criptocurrencies in a practical manner, and at the same time see the time for a transaction to be made.</p>\n<p>The strategy to arrive to the diverse sectors of the industries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Through digital marketing, there will be a campaign for the kermes and courses to be known.</li>\n<li>As entrepreneur, I have contacts with a lot employees, that is a huge &aacute;rea of opportunity to teach about digital money.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m an active member of a lot of work groups in branches of criptocurrencies, finantial education, goverment dependencies, and entrepeneur.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Possibles questions:</p>\n<p>Why a 20 hours course focused in 20-25 people by week?<br />My experience tell me que a group of 20 is excellent to have a customized attention and obtain the expected results on the gained knowledge, making easier that the quality of the information arrives to the community that will do it in the practice.</p>\n<p>Why 3 hours for day?<br />When I have done my courses, I have seen that after 3 hours, the attention span is lowered and the information is not received clearly, with 3 hours we can have the information fresh in the minds of the assistants.</p>\n<p>Why only 3 days?<br />There are 3 days dividen in this way: First day is theory, second day is practice and in the third day we will take the application of the 100% of what they learned.</p>\n<p>Conclusions:</p>\n<p>It is expected to reach a population of 80 to 100 people con la capacity to replicate the learned and viralize the information from a cemented

Live-read advertisements also give credence to the product/service because of the endorsement-style nature of that type of ad. I recommend the SmartCash team fund this advertising/promotion package so that SmartCash can continue to gain exposure to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>I'd like this to be a contract for 12 months, however the SmartCash voting system seems to limit proposals to not more than 2 months.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m Mark Edge, one of the hosts of Free Talk Live (Freetalklive.com). Free Talk Live (FTL) is a seven-day-a-week, live, nationally syndicated, pro-crypto radio program on more than 190 AM and FM radio stations (affiliates.freetalklive.com) across the US.</p>\n<p>Free Talk Live was the first consumer media in the world to discuss Bitcoin, in 2010, and Charlie Shrem said &ldquo;Bitcoin wouldn&rsquo;t even exist if it wasn&rsquo;t for you guys&rdquo;. Hyperbolic as that might be, it strongly hints at the power of FTL and these radio stations. These are real FCC licensed radio stations! You can see where they are on our radio transmitter map (radio.freetalklive.com). (This Summer we added 50,000 Watt WRKO in Boston - stations don&rsquo;t get any bigger than that.) Our show is heard on both conservative AND progressive talk stations - we&rsquo;re the only national issues-based show that is heard on both formats.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" title=\"screenshot-www.google.com-2018.11.26-14-25-20.jpg\" href=\"https://forum.smartcash.cc/uploads/default/original/2X/6/625d0be5b34134e35f4f0bdbd4c63334a8fa00c4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"//forum.smartcash.cc/uploads/default/625d0be5b34134e35f4f0bdbd4c63334a8fa00c4\"><img src=\"https://forum.smartcash.cc/uploads/default/original/2X/6/625d0be5b34134e35f4f0bdbd4c63334a8fa00c4.jpeg\" alt=\"26-14-25-20\" width=\"690\" height=\"363\" /></a></div>\n<p>However, our reach is not exclusive to radio stations. We also have more than 15 million downloads on our podcast and others listen to us via live streaming and our international satellite channels (more on that later). We&rsquo;ve been around the cryptocurrency world since 2011 and FTL is credited by Gavin Andresen and Roger Ver as helping to give Bitcoin the initial boost it needed to get widespread adoption.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Many of the earliest Bitcoin adopters first learned about it through Free Talk Live&hellip;I&rsquo;m convinced that is one of the sparks that turned a crazy little open source software project into a multi-billion dollar industry&rdquo; -Gavin Andresen, Original Bitcoin Head Developer</p>\n<p>&ldquo;By broadcasting this message since 2011&hellip;FTL has been instrumental in creating the widespread adoption that we have today.&rdquo; -Roger Ver, CEO&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bitcoin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bitcoin.com</a></p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t need Smartcash to build us a fancy studio or to help us start doing anything. We already have a studio and we&rsquo;ve been doing our show since 2002 and have been in national syndication since 2004. We&rsquo;re established in the industry and are the longest-running show in our daypart (7-10pm Eastern) in national syndication. We&rsquo;ve outlasted all of our competition. In case you doubt our claims of success, TALKERS Magazine (the premiere industry publication for talk radio) this year named us the&nbsp;<span class=\"hashtag\">#27</span>&nbsp;most important talk radio show as part of their &ldquo;Heavy Hundred&rdquo; It&rsquo;s our tenth year on the chart, and we&rsquo;ve been moving up every year. See it for yourself here: (Link to Heavy Hundred).</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.talkers.com/2018hh/cells/027.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"575\" height=\"288\" /></p>\n<p>As early adopters of Bitcoin, we&rsquo;ve done very well and are comfortable enough to be very choosy about which advertisers we accept. We are exicted about Smartcash after having <a href=\"https://www.freetalklive.com/podcast/2018-12-05\">Zaphoid on to talk about it</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This proposal is to bring Smartcash on as a prime sponsor of Free Talk Live. Per show, this means Smartcash receives three (3) :30 second recorded radio ads, one :30 podcast ad and one (1) Live Read ad (:60 seconds) per show. For the recorded ads we will work with your team to create several ads. We&rsquo;ll use different voices. This, we feel, helps function as a sort of &ldquo;Word of Mouth&rdquo; campaign. Listeners hear the same message repeated by many different people.</p>\n<p>Any comments you have are welcome. We are putting this in for 1 month of funding, but I must advise you that branding advertising is a long term endeavor. You need to stay on the air, if you want to stay top-of-mind. Repetition builds reputation. My recomendation is for AT Least a year. Bitcoin, via Roger Ver, has been on continuously, Since 2012. Persumably he knows something about building a brand.&nbsp;<br /><br />Besides Bitcoin, we have had people advertise other currencies like HoriZen (ZenCash), Monero and DASH. We are an open-lines radio program, but we like crypto. We would love it if any of you want to call in and talk about whay makes SmartCash a great tech for you. More voices is better. We aren't going to be The SmartCash Show, but we do want to hear from you. :-)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiu2K3h5J_fAhXkg-AKHetnAuwQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashcentral.org%2Fp%2Ffree-talk-live-renewal-expansion-2018&amp;psig=AOvVaw1H-T_tZWpMuWLL4Uw1-tdP&amp;ust=1544892924513400\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://forum.shiresociety.com/uploads/default/original/1X/e14d0762f9ac93f4588ef23e2a2274fdfdcb2825.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"248\" /></p>\n<p>I mentioned earlier that Free Talk Live is heard on <a href=\"http://sat.lrn.fm/\">international satellite channels</a>. It&rsquo;s called Free-to-Air satellite broadcasting and it&rsquo;s popular globally, especially in poorer countries. Poor people can&rsquo;t afford to pay for satellite channels. Free-to-Air is not encrypted, which means the channels cost nothing to receive. We&rsquo;ve been on satellite since 2010 over North and Central America (Galaxy 19) and over Sub-Saharan Africa (SES-5) since 2012. We know we&rsquo;re reaching people, as we&rsquo;ve heard from listeners in African nations like Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Kenya, and Nigeria. Here&rsquo;s a video&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/KV7zwG_J1yA\">from our satellite fundraiser on Patreon</a>&nbsp;that explains what we&rsquo;re doing in more detail and introduces you to our listener Ako in Cameroon:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/KV7zwG_J1yA\">link to video</a></p>\n<p>The satellite channel we&rsquo;re on is <a href=\"LRN.FM\">LRN.FM - The Liberty Radio Network</a>. It&rsquo;s a 24/7 internet-based streaming audio network that&rsquo;s been in existence since 2009 and we run it too. We figure our goal is to bring the Ideas of Liberty, which totally includes the concept of crypto currency, to as many people as possible, some people may not like our show, but may like another show. So we made LRN to service as many people as possible. We have the software and expertise already, so we are the best suited to run the best liberty network, and we have.</p>\n<p>This is important branding reaching people in their cars, homes, and on their headphones. Thank you for reading this far and for your vote.</p>\n<p>Break down of costs:</p>\n<p>FTL Major Sponsorship Package<br />7 live promotions per week @ $140 each = $980 per week<br />21 :30 second radio ads per week @ $30 each = $630 per week<br />7 :30 second podcast ads per week @ $20 each = $140 per week<br />125x100 banner on every page.<br />Large Banner on a major page of FreeTalkLive&rsquo;s site.<br />Periodic social media posts and a recorded interview for the podcast.<br />4 week Total = $6,160&nbsp;<br /><br />*We will hold the SMART and not sell it in the near future.&nbsp;</p>",

And most people will throw out they views/questions for us to have a discussion through facebook live together with one topic we choose to educate our community every week.</p>\n<p><br /> I have proposed smartcash to my team because I believe that our team vision is similar to smartcash; which is to bring value to community and to the public through cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>I personally feel that it would be best for us to interview the Smartcash developers. Alternatively, we can also interview the management team as well. We have been looking at your whitepaper and tracking the team&rsquo;s latest activities and upcoming events.</p>\n<p>Finally, SmartCash resonates strongly with us because you focus a great on community building and on real use cases for your coin; compared to many other Masternodes which just focus on people to buy your masternodes.</p>",

Live-read advertisements also give credence to the product/service because of the endorsement-style nature of that type of ad. I recommend the SmartCash team fund this advertising/promotion package so that SmartCash can continue to gain exposure to a wider audience.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Hyperbolic as that might be, it strongly hints at the power of FTL and these radio stations. These are real FCC licensed radio stations! You can see where they are on our radio transmitter map (radio.freetalklive.com). (This Summer we added 50,000 Watt WRKO in Boston and this week WONK-FM in Washington DC!) Our show is heard on both conservative AND progressive talk stations - we&rsquo;re the only national issues-based show that is heard on both formats.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><a title=\"screenshot-www.google.com-2018.11.26-14-25-20.jpg\" href=\"https://forum.smartcash.cc/uploads/default/original/2X/6/625d0be5b34134e35f4f0bdbd4c63334a8fa00c4.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://forum.smartcash.cc/uploads/default/original/2X/6/625d0be5b34134e35f4f0bdbd4c63334a8fa00c4.jpeg\" alt=\"26-14-25-20\" width=\"690\" height=\"363\" /></a></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, our reach is not exclusive to radio stations. We also have more than 15 million downloads on our podcast and others listen to us via live streaming and our international satellite channels (more on that later). We&rsquo;ve been around the cryptocurrency world since 2011 and FTL is credited by Gavin Andresen and Roger Ver as helping to give Bitcoin the initial boost it needed to get widespread adoption.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Many of the earliest Bitcoin adopters first learned about it through Free Talk Live&hellip;I&rsquo;m convinced that is one of the sparks that turned a crazy little open source software project into a multi-billion dollar industry&rdquo; -Gavin Andresen, Original Bitcoin Head Developer</p>\n<p>&ldquo;By broadcasting this message since 2011&hellip;FTL has been instrumental in creating the widespread adoption that we have today.&rdquo; -Roger Ver, CEO&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bitcoin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bitcoin.com</a></p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t need Smartcash to build us a fancy studio or to help us start doing anything. We already have a studio and we&rsquo;ve been doing our show since 2002 and have been in national syndication since 2004. We&rsquo;re established in the industry and are the longest-running show in our daypart (7-10pm Eastern) in national syndication. We&rsquo;ve outlasted all of our competition. In case you doubt our claims of success, TALKERS Magazine (the premiere industry publication for talk radio) this year named us the&nbsp;#27&nbsp;most important talk radio show as part of their &ldquo;Heavy Hundred&rdquo; It&rsquo;s our tenth year on the chart, and we&rsquo;ve been moving up every year. See it for yourself here: <a href=\"http://www.talkers.com/2018-talkers-heavy-hundred-26-50/\">(Link to Heavy Hundred).</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.talkers.com/2018hh/cells/027.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"575\" height=\"288\" /></p>\n<p>As early adopters of Bitcoin, we&rsquo;ve done very well and are comfortable enough to be very choosy about which advertisers we accept. We are exicted about Smartcash after having&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.freetalklive.com/podcast/2018-12-05\">Zaphoid on to talk about it</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This proposal is to bring Smartcash on as a prime sponsor of Free Talk Live. Per show, this means Smartcash receives three (3) :30 second recorded radio ads, one :30 podcast ad and one (1) Live Read ad (:60 seconds) per show. For the recorded ads we will work with your team to create several ads. We&rsquo;ll use different voices. This, we feel, helps function as a sort of &ldquo;Word of Mouth&rdquo; campaign. Listeners hear the same message repeated by many different people.</p>\n<p>Any comments you have are welcome. We are putting this in for our 2nd of funding, but I must advise you that branding advertising is a long term endeavor. You need to stay on the air, if you want to stay top-of-mind. Repetition builds reputation. My recomendation is for AT Least a year. Bitcoin, via Roger Ver, has been on continuously, Since 2012. Persumably he knows something about building a brand.&nbsp;<br /><br />Besides Bitcoin, we have had people advertise other currencies like HoriZen (ZenCash), Monero and DASH. We are an open-lines radio program, but we like crypto. We would love it if any of you want to call in and talk about whay makes SmartCash a great tech for you. More voices is better. We aren't going to be The SmartCash Show, but we do want to hear from you. :-)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiu2K3h5J_fAhXkg-AKHetnAuwQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashcentral.org%2Fp%2Ffree-talk-live-renewal-expansion-2018&amp;psig=AOvVaw1H-T_tZWpMuWLL4Uw1-tdP&amp;ust=1544892924513400\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://forum.shiresociety.com/uploads/default/original/1X/e14d0762f9ac93f4588ef23e2a2274fdfdcb2825.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"248\" /></p>\n<p>I mentioned earlier that Free Talk Live is heard on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sat.lrn.fm/\">international satellite channels</a>.

Free-to-Air is not encrypted, which means the channels cost nothing to receive.

It&rsquo;s a 24/7 internet-based streaming audio network that&rsquo;s been in existence since 2009 and we run it too. We figure our goal is to bring the Ideas of Liberty, which totally includes the concept of crypto currency, to as many people as possible, some people may not like our show, but may like another show. So we made LRN to service as many people as possible. We have the software and expertise already, so we are the best suited to run the best liberty network, and we have.</p>\n<p>This is important branding reaching people in their cars, homes, and on their headphones.

Anypay was already in heavy use in that area at the time. He saw how well Anypay worked for Dash payments, and we got to talking about integrating SMART on our free Point of Sale app. After some back and forth talks, I recommended holding off on integration until Anypay could deliver the outstanding experience SmartCash users deserve. After honing in the on-boarding, payment monitoring, and forwarding services, we are ready to deliver the same great experience for SMART as we do for DASH and the others.</p>\n<p><strong>Possible FAQ&rsquo;s:</strong></p>\n<p>Q) What unique advantages does Anypay bring to the table?</p>\n<p>A) Anypay created the World Famous Bitcoin Tour, which gained publicity when journalists from VICE visited from China to take the tour. Other than our intimate relationships with the merchants on our platform, Anypay has three major compelling advantages over other systems. First, openness. Anyone can use it. No complex forms or ID required. Second, ease of use. Your local minimum wage barista who is barely awake and barely sober can easily take payments in any cryptocurrency without any special instructions. We work closely with merchants to hone in on the most effortless and invisible way to collect payments securely and get on with the next customer. Third, we are die-hard libertarians. This is not something many companies boast, but we think it matters. We are dedicated to delivering the best possible product to the market not only because it is our business, but it is our business because we believe in building a freer society by facilitating free trade between individuals.</p>\n<p>Q) SMART is already integrated into CoinPayments and has its own POS built in. Why would we want to pay for another one?</p>\n<p>A) SMART benefits from use. The more people using it to buy real goods and services, the more value the currency has in the real world. CoinPayments is great for online use, but Anypay shines at retail. Yes, the SmartCash built-in POS might be better, but for whatever reason, merchants are a lot more likely to try Anypay than they are to try a POS specific to a coin they have never heard of. If anything, using Anypay will introduce them to SmartCash and make them a lot more willing to try the SMART POS in the future. Anypay gets SMART&rsquo;s foot in the door.</p>\n<p>Q) $7000 is a lot of money for a simple integration. Why so much?</p>\n<p>A) You get a job done right by a team of 2 professional engineers plus 1 heavy-hitting marketer for that price. And after the integration is complete, long-term benefits accrue to you for years. SmartCash gets lifetime support for SMART on Anypay. That means merchants or customers with questions can contact Anypay via phone, email, or chat and get their questions answered and problems resolved quickly. It also means that SMART benefits from future integrations and developments. When future customers pay for something like the ability to do cross-currency payments (spend SMART, receive BTC for example), then SMART benefits from that without any additional cost. Plus we continually are making the experience better, easier, and more fun for merchants and users. We recently added detailed charts that reveal what is really going on in the real-world crypto economy. Finally, we are always expanding to new areas and growing the number of merchants using our platform. That means ongoing exposure for merchants to SMART and more likelihood that they will accept SMART for payment, since many of our users have a Coinomi wallet to store their coins, and adding SMART is just as easy as a few taps.</p>\n<p><strong>Who Am I?

I produce liberty entertainment and am known for my years on Free Talk Live, Cop Block Radio, Peace News Now, Freedom Feens, and my movie, &ldquo;Derrick J&rsquo;s Victimless Crime Spree.&rdquo; Since 2011 I have been teaching people how to use cryptocurrency to increase their personal independence, and in 2017, my partner Steven and I created Anypay to help businesses in our area take bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies without the intrusive hassles of a BitPay account. Anypay now has 136 active accounts and facilitates retail crypto payments worth tens of thousands of dollars each month. Charts here: <a href=\"https://admin.anypay.global/#/charts\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://admin.anypay.global/#/charts</a> More here: <a href=\"https://charts.anypay.global/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://charts.anypay.global</a></p>\n<p>We are people who love freedom and who are using our bodies, time, and talent to create a world where everyone can use cryptocurrency. Our mission this year is to grow the number of active accounts worldwide from 136 today to 1,000 by the end of 2019. SMART&rsquo;s goals and Anypay&rsquo;s are aligned here in that we can only achieve this goal by integrating the coins that people want to use the most &mdash; the ones with real community and people focusing on using cryptocurrency as cash in their day to day lives. For this reason, we believe SmartCash and Anypay can benefit each other, and we humbly seek the opportunity to work together with you to grow the SmartHive one business at a time.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to a productive discussion on a partnership that grows the reach and utility of SMART!</p>",

            "description": "<div class=\"cooked\">\n<p>Hi,</p>\n<p><em>this is our 2nd proposal for the Balkan countries promotion. The first one has failed, and we weren&rsquo;t funded while other &lsquo;shady&rsquo; proposals were funded and never updated anything on this forum.</em></p>\n<p><strong>1. Timeline</strong></p>\n<p>We will organize 3 big meetups in Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb.<br />The event dates will be updated later on.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Proposal Goal</strong></p>\n<p>We want to make a big SmartCash community in this part of Europe - Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Croatia.</p>\n<p>Hence,&nbsp;<strong>we want to integrate SmartCash solution into E-Commerce and into the retail stores</strong>. However, we have to encourage everyone through our presentation to start integrating SmartCash solution into their business.</p>\n<p>We&nbsp;<em>can&rsquo;t do</em>&nbsp;it without meetups and showing what SmartCash can do on the spot!</p>\n<p>These countries can be the ideal country to spread the word about SmartCash.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s our main goal and we won&rsquo;t let you down!</p>\n<p><strong>3. Who Are We?</strong></p>\n<p>We are experienced IT professionals with more than 10 years experience in GSM field, and we have been operating as company since 2000.<br />Last five years we gained so much interest in Blockchain Technology and started developing blockchain based networks, decentralized apps, and distributed ledgers. We believe that these technologies are changing the world.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Our SmartCash Experience</strong></p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been interested in Bitcoin, SmartCash and other cryptocurrencies for a few years. SmartCash surprised us with it&rsquo;s cheap transactions and great stability. Community focused hive team concept is successful in decentralization and it&rsquo;s very helpful for any cryptocurrency project.<br />SmartNodes and SmartRewards are also huge step forward for steady network growth, but we still need to work much more.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Budget</strong></p>\n<p>We need monthly income for our projects to cover expenses on monthly basis for next 6-month period. However, we will keep track of our financial activity and will make all transparent during the period.<br />Beside our main expenses for the project, we will have travel, accommodation and meetup costs as well.<br />Amount needed for three events and for quality program and other expenses is&nbsp;<strong>4,500$US.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>6. Conclusions</strong></p>\n<p>The money we get from SmartCash we will use in the best possible way. We will try to promote as much as we can and we will try to include as many media as possible.</p>\n<p>We have so many ideas and we sincerely think we can realise it in cooperation with cryptocurrency such as we believe the SmartCash is.</p>\n</div>\n<section class=\"post-menu-area clearfix\"><nav class=\"post-controls clearfix\">\n<div class=\"actions\">\n<div class=\"like-button\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</nav></section>",

Charging for API access will begin turning potential customers/developers away. Instead of charging a monthly rate for API access I suggest making the API free to use if the customer/developer adds a \"Powered by SmartCash API\" badge to their website/service.</p>\n<p>By doing so SmartCash will enter the \"cryptocurrency utility\" space. The SmartCash API badge will begin boosting the seo of SmartCash when developers search for \"cryptocurrency market api's\" launching SmartCash to the top of search engine results.</p>\n<p>If the SmartCash team creates a documentation page for the API ( ex: api.smartcash.cc ) the team can provide a section outlining the SmartCash governance portal.</p>\n<p>This process will create a funnel attracting potential developers into the SmartCash ecosystem. The developer will enter by looking for the SmartCash API, and they will become interested in the possibility of developing x, y, z service for the SmartCash community in exchange for funding. The low cost of creating a proposal is also a very large incentive to create multiple proposals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Milestones</strong></p>\n<p><em>Cryptocurrency Market Data API</em></p>\n<p>I have already created a basic API that can be seen here ( https://cryptofeed.io/json ) I will expand on this API to return the exact prices from multiple exchanges.</p>\n<p><em>Cryptocurrency Social Media Data API</em></p>\n<p>This same service aggregates the social media data of each cryptocurrency and displays it in a central feed ( https://cryptofeed.io/eth ) I will create a JSON API that returns the social data of multiple cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p><em>Content Delivery Network ( CDN ) Caching</em></p>\n<p>If the SmartCash team would like to host this API the costs need to be kept to a minimum. When this service begins gaining traction the server bills can quickly add up if the API is not cached properly. Once the API's have been completed I will create the \"public access\" part of this service in a way that relies on the caching of CDN's. Once complete a free service like CloudFlare can be used to carry the heavy burden of handling large amounts of API calls.</p>",

This is a new market to reach out to as more daily people become familiar with the technology but don&rsquo;t know where to start and a great platform to reach into a new world.</p>\n<p>This could change the face of the Alt coin Market and add to the growth rate of projects that are pursuing large developments and want a larger or untapped Audience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Smart Cash given its established background and developed community would be a great addition to the game and would enhance the partnership we currently have.&nbsp;<span style=\"display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; cursor: text; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">Listing fee will be used to lock Coins into masternodes to create further coins for Game play.
